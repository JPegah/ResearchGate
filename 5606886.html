Neighborhoods of coefficients at adjacent positions and scales are modeled as the product of two independent random variables: a Gaussian vector and a hidden positive scalar multiplier. The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood, and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model, the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable. We demonstrate through simulations with images contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise that the performance of this method substantially surpasses that of previously published methods, both visually and in terms of mean squared error.</div> </p>  </div>  </div>   </div>     <div id="rgw18_56ab1c23636bd" class="figure-carousel"> <div class="carousel-hd"> Figures in this publication </div> <div class="carousel-bd"> <ul class="clearfix">  <li> <a href="/figure/5606886_fig1_Fig-6-Comparison-of-denoising-results-on-Barbara-image-cropped-to-150-2-150-for" class=" fig-frame js-click-link "  rel="tooltip" data-tooltip="Fig. 6.

The first is that the probability structure may be<br />definedlocally.Typically,onemakesaMarkovassumption,that<br />the probability density of a pixel, when conditioned on a set<br />of neighbors, is independent of the pixels beyond the neigh-<br />borhood. The second is an assumption of spatial homogeneity:<br />the distribution of values in a neighborhood is the same for all<br />suchneighborhoods,regardlessofabsolutespatialposition.The<br />Markovrandomfieldmodelthatresultsfromthesetwoassump-<br />tions is commonly simplified by assuming the distributions are<br />Gaussian. This last assumption is problematic for image mod-<br />eling, where the complexity of local structures is not well de-<br />scribed by Gaussian densities.<br />The power of statistical image models can be substantially<br />improved by transforming the signal from the pixel domain to<br />a new representation. Over the past decade, it has become stan-<br />dard to initiate computer-vision and image processing tasks by<br />decomposing the image with a set of multiscale bandpass ori-<br />ented filters.This kind of representation, loosely referred to as a<br />waveletdecomposition,iseffectiveatdecouplingthehigh-order<br />statistical features of natural images. In addition, it shares some<br />basic properties of neural responses in the primary visual cortex<br />of mammals which are presumably adapted to efficiently repre-<br />sent the visually relevant features of images.<br />A number of researchers have developed homogeneous local<br />probability models for images in multiscale oriented represen-<br />tations. Specifically, the marginal distributions of wavelet co-<br />efficients are highly kurtotic, and can be described using suit-<br />able long-tailed distributions. Recent work has investigated the<br />dependencies between coefficients, and found that the ampli-<br />tudes of coefficients of similar position, orientation and scale<br />are highly correlated. These higher order dependencies, as well<br />as the higher order marginal statistics, may be modeled by aug-<br />mentingasimpleparametricmodelforlocaldependencies(e.g.,<br />Gaussian) with a set of “hidden” random variables that govern<br />the parameters (e.g., variance). Such hidden Markov models<br />have become widely used, for example, in speech processing.<br />In this article, we develop a model for neighborhoods of ori-<br />ented pyramid coefficients based on a Gaussian scale mixture<br />[1]: the product of a Gaussian random vector, and an inde-<br />pendent hidden random scalar multiplier. We have previously<br />demonstrated that this model can account for both marginal<br />and pairwise joint distributions of wavelet coefficients [2], [3].<br />Here, we develop a local denoising solution as a Bayesian<br />least squares estimator, and demonstrate the performance of<br />this method on images corrupted by simulated additive white<br />Gaussian noise of known variance.<br />1057-7149/03$17.00 © 2003 IEEE</p>  <p>Page 2</p> <p>PORTILLA et al.: IMAGE DENOISING USING SCALE MIXTURES OF GAUSSIANS IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN1339<br />I. BACKGROUND: STATISTICAL IMAGE<br />MODELS AND DENOISING<br />Contemporary models of image statistics are rooted in the<br />television engineering of the 1950s (see [4] for review), which<br />relied on a characterization of the autocovariance function for<br />purposesofoptimalsignalrepresentationandtransmission.This<br />work,andnearlyallworksince,assumesthatimagestatisticsare<br />spatially homogeneous (i.e., strict-sense stationary). Another<br />common assumption in image modeling is that the statistics<br />are invariant, when suitably normalized, to changes in spatial<br />scale. The translation- and scale-invariance assumptions, cou-<br />pled with an assumption of Gaussianity, provides the baseline<br />model found throughout the engineering literature: images are<br />samples of a Gaussian random field, with variance falling as<br />in thefrequency domain. In thecontext ofdenoising, if one<br />assumes the noise is additive and independent of the signal, and<br />is also a Gaussian sample, then the optimal estimator is linear.<br />A. Modeling Non-Gaussian Image Properties<br />In recent years, models have been developed to account for<br />non-Gaussian behaviors of image statistics. One can see from<br />casual observation that individual images are highly inhomo-<br />geneous: they typically contain many regions that are smooth,<br />interspersed with “features” such as contours, or surface mark-<br />ings. This is reflected in the observed marginal distributions of<br />bandpass filter responses, which show a large peak at zero, and<br />tails that fall significantly slower than a Gaussian of the same<br />variance [5]–[7] [see Fig. 1(a)]. When one seeks a linear trans-<br />formation that maximizes the non-Gaussianity1of the marginal<br />responses, the result is a basis set of bandpass oriented filters of<br />different sizes spanning roughly an octave in bandwidth, e.g.,<br />[8], [9].<br />Duetothecombinationofthesequalitativeproperties,aswell<br />as an elegant mathematical framework, multiscale oriented sub-<br />band decompositions have emerged as the representations of<br />choice for many image processing applications. Within the sub-<br />bands of these representations, the kurtotic behaviors of coeffi-<br />cientsallowonetoremovenoiseusingapointnonlinearity.Such<br />approaches have become quite popular in the image denoising<br />literature, and typically are chosen to perform a type of thresh-<br />olding operation, suppressing low-amplitude values while re-<br />taininghigh-amplitudevalues.Theconceptwasdevelopedorig-<br />inally in the television engineering literature (where it is known<br />as “coring,” e.g., [10]), and specific shrinkage functions have<br />beenderivedunderavarietyofformulations,includingminimax<br />optimality under a smoothness condition [11], [12], [57], and<br />Bayesian estimation with non-Gaussian priors, e.g., [13]–[19],<br />[58].<br />In addition to the non-Gaussian marginal behavior, the re-<br />sponsesofbandpassfiltersexhibitimportantnon-Gaussianjoint<br />statistical behavior. In particular, even when they are second-<br />order decorrelated, the coefficients corresponding to pairs of<br />basis functions of similar position, orientation and scale ex-<br />hibit striking dependencies [20], [21]. Casual observation indi-<br />cates that large-amplitude coefficients are sparsely distributed<br />1Different authors have used different measures of non-Gaussianity, but have<br />obtained similar results.<br />(a)(b)<br />(c) (d)<br />Fig. 1.<br />(a vertical subband of the Boats image, left panels) with those arising from<br />simulation of a local GSM model (right panels).

The condi-<br />tional histograms of pairs of coefficients indicates that the stan-<br />dard deviation of a coefficient scales roughly linearly with the<br />amplitude of nearby coefficients [2], [21], [22] [see Fig. 1(c)].<br />Thedependencybetweenlocalcoefficientamplitudes,aswell<br />as the associated marginal behaviors, can be modeled using a<br />randomfieldwithaspatiallyfluctuatingvariance.Aparticularly<br />useful example arisesfrom the productof a Gaussian vectorand<br />a hidden scalar multiplier, known as a Gaussian scale mixture<br />[1] (GSM). GSM distributions represent an important subset<br />of the elliptically symmetric distributions, which are those that<br />can be defined as functions of a quadratic norm of the random<br />vector. Embedded in a random field, these kinds of models have<br />been found useful in the speech-processing community [23].<br />A related set of models, known as autoregressive conditional<br />heteroskedastic (ARCH) models, e.g., [24], have proven useful<br />for many real signals that suffer from abrupt fluctuations, fol-<br />lowed by relative “calm” periods (stock market prices, for ex-<br />ample). These kinds of ideas have also been found effective in<br />describingvisualimages.Forexample,Baraniukandcolleagues<br />used a 2-state hidden multiplier variable to characterize the two<br />modesofbehaviorcorrespondingtosmoothorlow-contrasttex-<br />tured regions and features [25], [26]. Our own work, as well as<br />that of others, assumes that the local variance is governed by a<br />continuous multiplier variable [2], [3], [27], [28]. This model<br />can capture the strongly leptokurtotic behavior of the marginal<br />densities of natural image wavelet coefficients, as well as the<br />correlation in their local amplitudes, as illustrated in Fig. 1.</p>  <p>Page 3</p> <p>1340 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. 12, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2003<br />B. Empirical Bayes Denoising Using Variance-Adaptive<br />Models<br />More than20yearsago,Lee[29] suggesteda two-stepproce-<br />dure for image denoising, in which one first estimates the local<br />signal variance from a neighborhood of observed pixels, and<br />then (proceeding as if this were the true variance) applies the<br />standard linear least squares (LLS) solution. This method is a<br />type of empirical Bayes estimator [30], in that a parameter of<br />the local model is first estimated from the data, and this esti-<br />mate is subsequently used to estimate the signal. This two-step<br />denoising solution can be applied to any of the variance-adap-<br />tive models described in Section I-A, and is substantially more<br />powerful when applied in a multiscale oriented representation.<br />Specifically, a number of authors have estimated the local vari-<br />ance from a collection of wavelet coefficients at nearby posi-<br />tions, scales, and/or orientations, and then used these estimated<br />variances in order to denoise the coefficients [16], [21], [28],<br />[31]–[33].<br />Solutions based on GSM models, with different prior as-<br />sumptions about the hidden variables, have produced some of<br />the most effective methods for removing homogeneous additive<br />noise from natural images to date. Our initial work in this<br />area developed a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator [34].<br />Mihçak et al. used a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator<br />based on an exponential marginal prior [28], as did Li and<br />Orchard [35], whereas Portilla et al. used a lognormal prior<br />[36]. Wainwright et al. developed a tree-structured Markov<br />model to provide a global description for the set of multiplier<br />variables [3]. Despite these successes, the two-step empirical<br />Bayes approach is suboptimal, even when the local variance<br />estimator is optimal, because the second step does not take into<br />account the uncertainty associated with the variance estimated<br />in the first step. In this paper, we derive a least squares optimal<br />single-step Bayesian estimator.<br />II. IMAGE PROBABILITY MODEL<br />As described in Section I, multiscale representations provide<br />a useful front-end for representing the structures of visual<br />images. But the widely used orthonormal or biorthogonal<br />wavelet representations are problematic for many applications,<br />including denoising. Specifically, they are critically sampled<br />(the number of coefficients is equal to the number of image<br />pixels), and this constraint leads to disturbing visual artifacts<br />(i.e., “aliasing” or “ringing”). A widely followed solution to<br />this problem is to use basis functionsdesigned for orthogonal or<br />biorthogonal systems, but to reduce or eliminate the decimation<br />of the subbands, e.g., [37].<br />Once the constraint of critical sampling has been dropped,<br />however, there is no need to limit oneself to these basis func-<br />tions. Significant improvement comes from the use of repre-<br />sentations with a higher degree of redundancy, as well as in-<br />creased selectivity in orientation [16], [19], [34], [38]. For the<br />current paper, we have used a particular variant of an overcom-<br />plete tight frame representation known as a steerable pyramid<br />[38], [39]. The basis functions of this multiscale linear decom-<br />position are spatially localized, oriented, and span roughly one<br />octaveinbandwidth.Theyarepolar-separableintheFourierdo-<br />main,andarerelatedbytranslation,dilation,androtation.Other<br />authors have developed representations with similar properties<br />[19], [40]–[42]. Details of the steerable pyramid representation<br />are provided in Appendix A.<br />A. Gaussian Scale Mixtures<br />Consider an image decomposed into oriented subbands<br />at multiple scales. We denote as<br />corresponding to a linear basis function at scale , orientation<br />, and centered at spatial location<br />a neighborhood of coefficients clustered around<br />this reference coefficient2. In general, the neighborhood may<br />include coefficients from other subbands (i.e., corresponding<br />to basis functions at nearby scales and orientations), as well as<br />from the same subband. In our case, we use a neighborhood<br />of coefficients drawn from two subbands at adjacent scales,<br />thus taking advantage of the strong statistical coupling ob-<br />served through scale in multiscale representations. Details are<br />provided in Section IV.<br />We assume the coefficients within each local neighborhood<br />around a reference coefficient of a pyramid subband are charac-<br />terized by a Gaussian scale mixture (GSM) model. Formally, a<br />random vector<br />is a Gaussian scale mixture [1] if and only if it<br />can be expressed as the product of a zero-mean Gaussian vector<br />and an independent positive scalar random variable<br />the coefficient<br />. We denote as<br />(1)<br />where<br />known as the multiplier. The vector<br />ture of Gaussian vectors, whose density is determined by the<br />covariance matrix<br />of vector<br />indicates equality in distribution. The variableis<br />is thus an infinite mix-<br />and the mixing density,<br />(2)<br />where<br />the neighborhood). Without loss of generality, one can assume<br />, which implies<br />The conditions under which a random vector may be repre-<br />sented using a GSM have been studied [1]. The GSM family<br />includes a variety of well-known families of random variables<br />such as the -stable family (including the Cauchy distribution),<br />the generalized Gaussian (or stretched exponential) family<br />and the symmetrized Gamma family [3]. GSM densities<br />are symmetric and zero-mean, and they have leptokurtotic<br />marginal densities (i.e., heavier tails than a Gaussian).

GSM Model for the Wavelet Coefficients<br />As explained in Section I and illustrated in Fig. 1, a GSM<br />model can account for both the shape of wavelet coefficient<br />marginals and the strong correlation between the amplitudes<br />of neighbor coefficients [2], [3]. In order to construct a global<br />model for images from this local description, one must specify<br />both the neighborhood structure of the coefficients, and the dis-<br />tribution of the multipliers. The definition of (and calculations<br />using) the global model is considerably simplified by parti-<br />tioning the coefficients into nonoverlapping neighborhoods.<br />One can then specify either a marginal model for the multipliers<br />(treating them as independent variables) [43], or specify a joint<br />density over the full set of multipliers [3]. Unfortunately, the<br />use of disjoint neighborhoods leads to noticeable denoising<br />artifacts at the discontinuities introduced by the neighborhood<br />boundaries.<br />AnalternativeapproachistouseaGSMasalocaldescription<br />of the behavior of the cluster of coefficients centered at each co-<br />efficient in the pyramid. Since the neighborhoods overlap, each<br />coefficient will be a member of many neighborhoods. The local<br />model implicitlydefines a global(Markov) model, described by<br />the conditional density of a coefficient in the cluster given its<br />surroundingneighborhood,assumingconditionalindependence<br />on the rest of the coefficients. But the structure of the resulting<br />model is such that performing statistical inference (i.e., com-<br />puting Bayes estimates) in an exact way is quite challenging.<br />In this paper, we simply solve the estimation problem for the<br />reference coefficient at the center of each neighborhood inde-<br />pendently.<br />C. Prior Density for Multiplier<br />To complete the model, we need to specify the probability<br />density,<br />, of the multiplier. Several authors have sug-<br />gested the generalized Gaussian (stretched exponential) family<br />of densities as an appropriate description of wavelet coefficient<br />marginal densities [7], [13], [17]:<br />where the scaling variable controls the width of the distribu-<br />tion, and the exponent<br />controls the shape (in particular, the<br />heaviness of the tails), and is typically estimated to lie in the<br />range<br />for image subbands. Although these can be ex-<br />pressed as GSM’s, the density of the associated multiplier has<br />no closed form expression, and thus this solution is difficult to<br />implement.<br />In previous work [36], we noted that for the case<br />the density of the log coefficient magnitude,<br />written as a convolution of the densities of<br />Since the density of<br />is known, this means that estimation<br />of the density of<br />may be framed as a deconvolution<br />problem. The resulting estimated density may be approximated<br />byaGaussian,correspondingtoalognormalpriorforthe .This<br />solution has two important drawbacks. First, it is only extrapo-<br />lable to the<br />case when all the neighbors have the same<br />marginal statistics, which, in practice requires they all belong to<br />the same subband. Second, it is estimated from the noise-free<br />coefficients, and it is difficult to extend it for use in the noisy<br />case.<br />,<br />, may be<br />and.<br />We have also investigated a more direct maximum likeli-<br />hood approach for estimating a nonparametric<br />observed set of neighborhood vectors<br />from an<br />(3)<br />wherethesumisovertheneighborhoods.Notethattheestimate,<br />,mustbeconstrainedtopositivevalues,andmusthaveunit<br />area. We have developed an efficient algorithm for computing<br />this solution numerically. One advantage of the ML solution is<br />that it is easily extended for use with the noisy observations, by<br />replacing<br />with the noisy observation.<br />A fourth choice is a so-called noninformative prior [44],<br />which has the advantage that it does not require the fitting of<br />any parameters to the noisy observation. Such solutions have<br />been used in establishing marginal priors for image denoising<br />[45]. We have examined the most widely used solution, known<br />as Jeffrey’s prior (see [44]). In the context of estimating the<br />multiplier<br />from coefficients , this takes the form:<br />where<br />the GSM model is straightforward<br />is the Fisher information matrix. Computing this for<br />Taking the square root of the expectation, and using the fact that<br />we obtain Jeffrey’s prior<br />(4)<br />which corresponds to a constant prior on<br />is an improper probability density. Nevertheless it is common to<br />ignore this fact as long as it does not create computational prob-<br />lems at the estimation stage. In our case, we have set the prior<br />to zero in the interval<br />to prevent such problems, where<br />is a small positive constant (see Section IV for details).<br />Of the four alternatives described above, we have found (as<br />expected) that the ML-estimated nonparametric prior produces<br />the best results for denoising the pyramid coefficients. But a<br />least squares optimal estimate for the pyramid coefficients does<br />not necessarily lead to a least-squares optimal estimate for the<br />image pixels, since the pyramid representation is overcomplete.<br />We were surprised to find that the noninformative prior typi-<br />callyleadstobetterdenoisingperformanceintheimagedomain<br />(roughly<br />, on average). Given that it is also simpler<br />and more efficient to implement, we have used it for all of the<br />results shown in Sections III–V.<br />.

IMAGE DENOISING<br />Our procedure for image denoising uses the same top-level<br />structure as most previously published approaches: 1) decom-<br />pose the image into pyramid subbands at different scales and<br />orientations; 2) denoise each subband, except for the lowpass<br />residualband;and3)invertthepyramidtransform,obtainingthe<br />denoised image. We assume the image is corrupted by indepen-<br />dent additive white Gaussian noise of known variance (note that<br />the method can also handle nonwhite Gaussian noise of known<br />covariance). A vector<br />corresponding to a neighborhood of<br />observed coefficients of the pyramid representation can be ex-<br />pressed as<br />(5)<br />Note that the assumed GSM structure of the coefficients,<br />coupled with the assumption of independent additive Gaussian<br />noise, means that the three random variables on the right side<br />of (5) are independent.<br />Both<br />andare zero-mean Gaussian vectors, with associ-<br />ated covariance matrices<br />and<br />served neighborhood vector conditioned on<br />Gaussian, with covariance<br />.

IMPLEMENTATION<br />We decompose the image into subbands using a specialized<br />variant of the steerable pyramid. The representation consists<br />of oriented bandpass bands at 8 orientations and 5 scales, 8<br />oriented highpass residual subbands, and one lowpass (nonori-<br />ented) residual band, for a total of 49 subbands. A detailed de-<br />scription of the decomposition is given in Appendix A.<br />We have hand-optimized the neighborhood structure (i.e.,<br />choice of spatial positions, scales and orientations). A 3<br />3<br />region surrounding the reference coefficient, together with the<br />coefficientatthesamelocationandorientationatthenextcoarser<br />scale (the parent), maximizes the denoising performance, on<br />average. Inclusion of parent coefficient has been found to<br />provide a significant improvement in performance in a number<br />of applications, e.g., [21], [22], [25], [26], [46]. Note that<br />since the parent subband is sampled at half the density of<br />the reference subband, it must be upsampled and interpolated<br />in order to obtain values for neighborhoods at every choice<br />of reference coefficient. Two exceptions must be applied:<br />1) the highpass oriented subbands, whose parents have the<br />same number of samples as them (no interpolation is required<br />for those parents); and 2) the subbands at the coarsest scale,<br />which have no parent subband (we simply use the 3<br />neighborhood for those subbands). Note that in terms of image<br />pixels, the spatial extent of the neighborhood depends on the<br />scale of the subband (the basis functions grow in size as<br />as is appropriate under the assumption that image statistics are<br />scale-invariant [47], [48].<br />In our implementation, the integral of (8) is computed nu-<br />merically. The range and sample spacing for this integration are<br />chosen as a compromise between accuracy and computational<br />cost. Specifically, we sample<br />spacing, which we have observed to require fewer samples, for<br />the same quality, than linear sampling. Note also that Jeffrey’s<br />improper prior for<br />is a constant under a logarithmic represen-<br />tation. We use only<br />samples of<br />using steps of size 2. We have chosen<br />and<br />chosen as the minimal value that guarantees in practice that the<br />right-tails of all the posteriors are properly covered by the in-<br />tegration interval. In contrast,<br />that the left tail of the posterior is integrable. We have hand-op-<br />timized<br />to maximize the performance of the algorithm,<br />and have found that denoising performance is relatively insen-<br />sitive to changes in this parameter. Only slightly worse results<br />(<br />to) result from choosing<br />the interval<br />, and reasonable performance (<br />to) is obtained with values as low as<br />responds to<br />).<br />Thecomputationalcost<br />(both forward and inverse) scales as<br />where<br />are the dimensions of the image.

Comparison to Model Variants<br />In order to understand the relative contribution of various as-<br />pects of our method, we considered two restricted versions of<br />our model that are representative of the two primary denoising<br />concepts found in the literature. The first is a Gaussian model,<br />arising from the restriction of our model to a prior density<br />which is a delta function concentrated at one. This model is not<br />variance-adaptive,and,thus,isgloballyGaussian.Note,though,<br />that the signal covariance is modeled only locally (over the ex-<br />tent of the neighborhood) for each pyramid subband. As such,<br />this denoising solution may be viewed as a regularized version<br />of the classical linear (Wiener filter) solution. In order to imple-<br />ment this, we simply estimate each coefficient using (12), with<br />set to one.<br />Thesecond restricted form of ourmodel usesa neighborhood<br />containing only the reference coefficient (i.e., 1<br />these conditions, the model describes only the marginal density<br />of the coefficients, and the estimator reduces to application of a<br />scalar function to the observed noisy coefficients. The function<br />resulting from the reduction of our model to a single-element<br />neighborhood is shown in Fig. 2(a). This is similar to the BLS<br />solutions derived in [13], [16] for a generalized Gaussian prior,<br />except that it is independent of the clean signal statistics, and<br />its normalized form<br />scales with the noise standard<br />deviation of the subband,<br />(as in [11]).<br />It is also instructive to examine the nonlinear estimator asso-<br />ciated with the case of two neighbors. Fig. 2(b) shows the es-<br />timator obtained as a function of the reference coefficient and<br />1).

Parameters for both methods have been optimized for each image and noise level: a threshold level for the first<br />method, and a neighborhood size (ranging from 3 to 11) for the second. (c) Two denoising algorithms applied to our steerable pyramid representation: adaptive<br />Wiener [29], using a hand-optimized size of neighborhood (19?19 for all the images and noise levels) (circles), and hard-thresholding, optimizing the threshold<br />for every image and noise level (diamonds).

Loosely speaking, the refer-<br />encecoefficientissuppressedonlywhenbothitsownamplitude<br />and the parent’s amplitude are small. Adjacent neighbors in the<br />same subband have a similar effect on the estimation. Sendur<br />and Selesnick have recently developed a MAP estimator based<br />on a circular-symmetric Laplacian density model for a coeffi-<br />cient and its parent [49], [50]. Their resulting shrinkage func-<br />tion is qualitatively similar to that of Fig. 2(b), except that ours<br />is smoother and, due to covariance adaptation, its “dead zone”<br />is not necessary aligned with the input axes.<br />Fig. 3(a) shows a comparison of our full model and the two<br />reduced forms explained above. Note that the 1-D shrinkage<br />solution outperforms the jointly Gaussian (nonadaptive) solu-<br />tion, which still provides relatively good results, especially at<br />low SNR rates. The full model (adaptive and context-sensitive)<br />incorporates the advantages of the two subcases, and thus out-<br />performs both of them.<br />We have also examined the relative importance of other as-<br />pects of our method. Table II shows the decrease in PSNR that<br />results when each of a set of features is removed. The first<br />three columns correspond to features of the representation, the<br />next two to features of the model, and the last to the estimation<br />method. Within the first group, decreasing the number of orien-<br />tation bands from<br />to(Ori8) leads to a significant<br />drop in performance. We havealso found that further increasing<br />the number of orientations leads to additional PSNR improve-<br />ment, at the expense of considerable computational and storage<br />cost. The second column (OrHPR) shows the effect of not par-<br />titioning the highpass residual band into oriented components<br />(the standard form of the pyramid, as used in our previous de-<br />noising work [34], [36], has only a single nonoriented highpass<br />residual band). The third column (Bdry) shows the reduction in<br />performance that results when switching from mirror-reflected<br />extension to periodic boundary handling.<br />The first feature of the model we examined is the inclusion<br />of the coarse-scale parent coefficient in the neighborhood. The<br />fourth column (Prnt) shows that eliminating the coarse-scale<br />parent from the neighborhood decreases performance signifi-<br />cantly only at high noise levels.

Comparison to Standard Methods<br />We have compared our method to two well-known and<br />widely-available denoising algorithms: a local variance-adap-<br />tive method in the pixel domain [29] (as implemented by the<br />Matlab function wiener2), and a hard thresholding method<br />using an undecimated representation [37] with five scales based<br />on the minimum-phase Daubechies 8-tap wavelet filter. In both<br />cases, a single parameter (the neighborhood size or a common<br />threshold for all the subbands) was optimized independently for<br />each image at each noise level. Results are shown in Fig. 3(b).<br />Our method is seen to clearly outperform the other two over the<br />entire range of noise levels. We also see the superiority of the<br />two multiscale methods over the pixel-domain method. Fig. 4<br />provides a visual comparison of example images denoised<br />using these two algorithms. Our method produces artifacts that<br />are significantly less visible, and at the same time is able to<br />better preserve the features of the original image.<br />It is natural to ask to what extent the results in the previous<br />comparison are due to the representation (steerable pyramid) as<br />opposedtotheestimationmethoditself(BLS-GSM).Inorderto<br />answer this, we have performed two more sets of experiments,<br />comparing the performance of different combinations of repre-<br />sentation and estimator. First, we have applied the two estima-<br />tion methods used in Fig. 3(b) to the coefficients of the steer-<br />able pyramid representation. For the adaptive Wiener method<br />[29], we have found that the hand-optimized neighborhood size<br />within the subbands is roughly 19<br />thepixeldomain.Forthetranslationinvarianthard-thresholding<br />method [37], we have optimized a common threshold for each<br />image and noise level (note that the steerable pyramid subband<br />impulse responses are not normalized in energy, so the common<br />threshold needs to be properly re-scaled for each subband). Re-<br />sults are plotted in Fig. 3(c). It is clear that the use of the new<br />representation improves the results and reduces the difference<br />between the methods. The adaptive Wiener method is even seen<br />to outperform ours at very high input SNR’s. But significant<br />differences in performance remain, and these are due entirely to<br />the use of the BLS-GSM estimation method.<br />In a second experiment, we compared the performance of<br />our estimation method when applied to coefficients of two dif-<br />19—much larger than in<br />(a)<br />(b)<br />Fig. 4.<br />for visibility of the artifacts).

This representation is analogous to the steerable<br />pyramid: both the highpass oriented subbands and the bandpass<br />highest frequency oriented subbands are kept at full resolution,<br />and the rest are downsampled in a dyadic scheme.

From left to right and top to bottom: Original<br />VI. CONCLUSIONS<br />We have presented a denoising method based on a local<br />Gaussian scale mixture model in an overcomplete oriented<br />pyramid representation. Our statistical model differs from<br />previous models in a number of important ways. First, many<br />previousmodelshavebeenbasedoneitherseparableorthogonal<br />wavelets, or redundant versions of such wavelets. In contrast,<br />our model is based on an overcomplete tight frame that is free<br />fromaliasing,andthatincludesbasisfunctionsthatareselective<br />for oblique orientations. The increased redundancy of the rep-<br />resentation and the higher ability to discriminate orientations<br />results in improved performance. Second, our model explicitly<br />incorporates the covariance between neighboring coefficients<br />(for both signal and noise), as opposed to considering only<br />marginal responses or local variance. Thus, the model captures<br />correlations induced by the overcomplete representation as<br />well as correlations inherent in the underlying image, and it<br />can handle Gaussian noise of arbitrary power spectral density.<br />Third, we have included a neighbor from the same orientation<br />and spatial location at a coarser scale (a parent), as opposed to<br />considering only spatial neighbors within each subband. This<br />modeling choice is consistent with the empirical findings of<br />strong statistical dependence across scale in natural images,<br />e.g., [4], [46]. Note, however, that the inclusion of the parent<br />results in only a modest increase in performance compared to<br />the other elements shown in Table II. We believe the impact of<br />including a parent is limited by the simplicity of our model,<br />which only characterizes the correlation of the coefficients and<br />the correlation of their amplitudes (see below).<br />In addition to these modeling differences, there are also dif-<br />ferences between our denoising method and previous methods<br />based on continuous hidden-variable models [3], [28], [32],<br />[34], [36]. First, we compute the full optimal local Bayesian<br />least squares solution, as opposed to first estimating the local<br />variance, and then using this to estimate the coefficient. We<br />have shown empirically that this approach yields an important<br />improvement in the results. Also, we use the vectorial form of<br />theLLS solution(9),so takingfulladvantageoftheinformation<br />provided by the covariance modeling of signal and noise. These<br />enhancements, together with a convenient choice for the prior<br />of the hidden multiplier (a noninformative prior, independent<br />of the observed signal), result in a substantial improvement<br />in the quality of the denoised images, while keeping the<br />computational cost reasonably low.<br />We are currently working on several extensions of the<br />estimator presented here. First, we have begun developing<br />a variant of this method to denoise color images taken with<br />a commercial digital camera [53]. We find that the sensor<br />noise of such cameras has two important features that must<br />be characterized through calibration measurements: spatial<br />and cross-channel correlation, and signal-dependence. We are<br />also extending the denoising solution to address the complete<br />image restoration problem, by incorporating a model of image<br />blur [54]. Finally, we are developing an ML estimator for the<br />noise variance, when the normalized power spectral density</p>  <p>Page 12</p> <p>PORTILLA et al.: IMAGE DENOISING USING SCALE MIXTURES OF GAUSSIANS IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN1349<br />Fig. 7.<br />of highpass oriented bands. The lowpass band is then split into a lower-frequency band and a set of oriented subbands. The pyramid recursion consists of inserting<br />the diagram contents of the shaded region at the lowpass branch (solid circle). (b) Basis function corresponding to an example oriented subband, and idealized<br />depiction of the frequency domain partition ?? ? ??? ? ??, with gray region corresponding to this basis function.<br />(a) System diagram for the extended version of the steerable pyramid used in this paper [38]. The input image is first split into a lowpass band and a set<br />of the noise is assumed known. Preliminary results of these<br />extensions appear very promising.<br />We believe that the current image model can be improved in<br />a number of ways. It would be desirable to develop a method<br />for efficiently estimating a prior for the multiplier by maxi-<br />mizing the joint likelihood of the observed subbands, as op-<br />posed to the somewhat heuristic choice of noninformative prior<br />(corrected at the origin) we have presented. Similarly, it would<br />also be desirable to minimize the expected quadratic error in<br />the image domain, instead of doing it for the subband coeffi-<br />cients. In addition, it is worth exploring the transformation of<br />the local GSM model into an explicit Markov model with over-<br />lapping neighborhoods, as opposed to the nonoverlapping tree-<br />structured models previously developed [3], [25]. This concep-<br />tual simplification would facilitate other applications requiring<br />a conditional local density model (e.g., synthesis or coding). Fi-<br />nally, from a longer-term perspective, major improvements are<br />likely to come from statistical models that capture important<br />structural properties of local image features, by including addi-<br />tional dependencies such as phase congruency between the co-<br />efficients of complex multiscale oriented transforms, e.g., [55],<br />[56].<br />APPENDIX A<br />STEERABLE PYRAMID<br />We use a transform known as a steerable pyramid [38],<br />[39] to decompose images into frequency subbands. The<br />transform is implemented in the Fourier domain, allowing<br />exact reconstruction of the image from the subbands, as well<br />as a flexible choice of the number of orientations<br />scales<br />. A software implementation (in Matlab) is avail-<br />able at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/software.html. As with<br />conventional orthogonal wavelet decompositions, the pyramid<br />is implemented by recursively splitting an image into a set of<br />oriented subbands, and a lowpass residual band which is sub-<br />sampledbyafactoroftwoalongbothaxes.Unlikeconventional<br />and<br />orthogonal wavelet decompositions, the oriented bands are not<br />subsampled, and the subsampling of the lowpass band does<br />not produce aliasing artifacts, as the lowpass filter is designed<br />to obey the Nyquist sampling criterion. When performing<br />convolutions, the boundaries are handled by mirror extension<br />(reflection) of the image, thereby maintaining continuity. Since<br />it is a tight frame, the transformation may be inverted by con-<br />volving each subband with its associated complex-conjugated<br />filter and adding the results.

in low level vision such as image denoising. In particular,
the use of image nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior,
which refers to the fact that a local patch often has many
nonlocal similar patches to it across the image, has significantly
enhanced the denoising performance. However, in
most existing methods only the NSS of input degraded image
is exploited, while how to utilize the NSS of clean natural
images is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose
a patch group (PG) based NSS prior learning scheme
to learn explicit NSS models from natural images for high
performance denoising. PGs are extracted from training
images by putting nonlocal similar patches into groups, and
a PG based Gaussian Mixture Model (PG-GMM) learning
algorithm is developed to learn the NSS prior. We demonstrate
that, owe to the learned PG-GMM, a simple weighted
sparse coding model, which has a closed-form solution, can
be used to perform image denoising effectively, resulting in
high PSNR measure, fast speed, and particularly the best
visual quality among all competing methods. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">   <span class="ico-publication-fulltext reset-background"></span> Full-text   &middot; Conference Paper &middot; Dec 2015  </div>        <div class="publication-actions"> <div class="btn-group">  <a class="btn btn-plain action-download primary  open-viewer" href="profile/Jun_Xu81/publication/284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising/links/564b1dad08ae295f64513559.pdf?origin=publication_list">  <span class="js-btn-label">Download</span> </a>    </div> </div>      </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication   includes-citation-list"  id="rgw37_56ab1c23636bd" >  <div class="indent-left">  <div id="rgw38_56ab1c23636bd" class="js-publication-item-fulltext fulltext-thumb">    <a class="publication-preview ga-publication-viewer js-publication-item-fulltext-content" href="publication/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors">       </a>   <div class="preview-source-info"> <a class="details js-show-source ga-source-url" href="profile/Javier_Portilla2" >Source</a>  <div class="tooltip-content" style="display: none"> Available from: Javier Portilla </div> </div>   </div>  </div>  <div class="indent-right">      </div>  <ul class="citation-contexts" id="rgw39_56ab1c23636bd">  <li class="citation-context-item"> "More recently, we are witnessing a convergence of &quot; the best of both worlds &quot; of sparsity in redundant dictionaries and non-local redundancy, with highly impressive results for restoration [14]–[17]. Similarly, some other models have proposed combining the &quot; conditionally Gaussian &quot; description (e.g., Gaussian mixtures, as in the adaptation of the denoising method in [18] to image restoration [8]) with learning the nonlocal redundancy of the image [19], [20].

Our formulation of a L2-relaxed L0 pseudonorm prior allows for an especially simple MAP estimation iterative marginal optimization algorithm, whose convergence we prove. We achieve a significant speed-up over the direct (static) solution by using dynamically evolving parameters through the estimation loop. As an added heuristic twist, we fix in advance the number of iterations, and then empirically optimize the involved parameters according to two performance benchmarks. The resulting constrained dynamic method is not just fast and effective, it is also highly robust and flexible. First, it is able to provide an outstanding trade-off between computational load and performance, in visual and objective -MSE, SSIM- terms, for a large variety of degradation tests, using the same set of parameter values for all tests. Second, the performance benchmark can be easily adapted to specific types of degradation, image classes, and even performance criteria. Third, it allows for using simultaneously several dictionaries with complementary features. This unique combination makes ours a highly practical deconvolution method. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">   <span class="ico-publication-fulltext reset-background"></span> Full-text   &middot; Article &middot; Nov 2015  &middot; IEEE Transactions on Image Processing  </div>        <div class="publication-actions"> <div class="btn-group">  <a class="btn btn-plain action-download primary  open-viewer" href="profile/Javier_Portilla2/publication/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors/links/564d97e508aeafc2aaaff41b.pdf?origin=publication_list">  <span class="js-btn-label">Download</span> </a>    </div> </div>      </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication   includes-citation-list"  id="rgw40_56ab1c23636bd" >  <div class="indent-left">  <div id="rgw41_56ab1c23636bd" class="js-publication-item-fulltext fulltext-thumb">    <a class="publication-preview ga-publication-viewer js-publication-item-fulltext-content" href="publication/283910551_Deep_Gaussian_Conditional_Random_Field_Network_A_Model-based_Deep_Network_for_Discriminative_Denoising">       </a>   <div class="preview-source-info"> <a class="details js-show-source ga-source-url" href="profile/Raviteja_Vemulapalli2" >Source</a>  <div class="tooltip-content" style="display: none"> Available from: Raviteja Vemulapalli </div> </div>   </div>  </div>  <div class="indent-right">      </div>  <ul class="citation-contexts" id="rgw42_56ab1c23636bd">  <li class="citation-context-item"> "Denoising: Image denoising is one of the oldest problems in image processing and various denoising algorithms have been proposed over the past several years.

In contrast to the existing discriminative denoising methods that train a separate model for each noise level, the proposed deep network explicitly models the input noise variance and hence is capable of handling a range of noise levels. Our deep network, which we refer to as deep GCRF network, consists of two sub-networks: (i) a parameter generation network that generates the pairwise potential parameters based on the noisy input image, and (ii) an inference network whose layers perform the computations involved in an iterative GCRF inference procedure. We train the entire deep GCRF network (both parameter generation and inference networks) discriminatively in an end-to-end fashion by maximizing the peak signal-to-noise ratio measure. Experiments on Berkeley segmentation and PASCALVOC datasets show that the proposed deep GCRF network outperforms state-of-the-art image denoising approaches for several noise levels. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">   <span class="ico-publication-fulltext reset-background"></span> Full-text   &middot; Article &middot; Nov 2015  </div>        <div class="publication-actions"> <div class="btn-group">  <a class="btn btn-plain action-download primary  open-viewer" href="profile/Raviteja_Vemulapalli2/publication/283910551_Deep_Gaussian_Conditional_Random_Field_Network_A_Model-based_Deep_Network_for_Discriminative_Denoising/links/564a094e08ae127ff986736d.pdf?origin=publication_list">  <span class="js-btn-label">Download</span> </a>    </div> </div>      </li>  </ul>    <a class="show-more-rebranded js-show-more rf text-gray-lighter">Show more</a> <span class="ajax-loading-small list-loading" style="display: none"></span>  <div class="clearfix"></div>  <div class="publication-detail-sidebar-legal">Note: This list is based on the publications in our database and might not be exhaustive.</div> <div class="clearfix"></div>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="clearfix">     <div id="rgw27_56ab1c23636bd" class="c-box pub-resource-container js-toggle" style="display: none;"> <h4 class="lf js-expand-list"><small><a href="javascript:" class="lf">View other sources <span class="ico-expand-list"></span></a></small></h4> <h4 class="lf js-collapse-list hidden"><small><a href="javascript:" class="lf">Hide other sources <span class="ico-collapse-list"></span></a></small></h4> <div class="clear"></div> <div class="scroll-wrapper hidden"> <ul class="files-list c-list" id="rgw28_56ab1c23636bd">  </ul> </div> </div>   <div id="rgw19_56ab1c23636bd" class="similar-publications"> <h2>Similar Publications</h2> <ul class="list-bordered">  <li class="c-list-item li-publication-teaser" id="rgw20_56ab1c23636bd"> <div> <h5> <a href="publication/260671992_Advanced_statistical_tools_for_enhanced_quality_digital_imaging_with_realistic_capture_models_Advanced_Statistical_Tools_for_Enhanced_Quality_Digital_Imaging_with_Realistic_Capture_Models" class="color-inherit ga-similar-publication-title"><span class="publication-title">Advanced statistical tools for enhanced quality digital imaging with realistic capture models Advanced Statistical Tools for Enhanced Quality Digital Imaging with Realistic Capture Models</span></a>  </h5>  <div class="authors"> <a href="researcher/53569079_Aleksandra_Pizurica" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Aleksandra Pižurica</a>, <a href="researcher/2045036645_Javier_Portilla" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Javier Portilla</a>, <a href="researcher/2044987782_Keigo_Hirakawa" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Keigo Hirakawa</a>, <a href="researcher/8107252_Karen_Egiazarian" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Karen Egiazarian</a>  </div>  </div> <div class="clear"></div> </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication-teaser" id="rgw21_56ab1c23636bd"> <div> <h5> <a href="publication/4248276_Multivariate_Statistical_Modeling_for_Medical_Image_Compression_Using_Wavelet_Transforms" class="color-inherit ga-similar-publication-title"><span class="publication-title">Multivariate Statistical Modeling for Medical Image Compression Using Wavelet Transforms</span></a>  </h5>  <div class="authors"> <a href="researcher/12869428_Yuehua_Wan" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Yuehua Wan</a>, <a href="researcher/12869429_Shiming_Ji" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Shiming Ji</a>, <a href="researcher/32044252_Qiaoling_Yuan" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Qiaoling Yuan</a>, <a href="researcher/2013668248_Yi_Xie" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Yi Xie</a>  </div>  </div> <div class="clear"></div> </li>  </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div></div>

Neighborhoods of coefficients at adjacent positions and scales are modeled as the product of two independent random variables: a Gaussian vector and a hidden positive scalar multiplier. The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood, and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model, the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable. We demonstrate through simulations with images contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise that the performance of this method substantially surpasses that of previously published methods, both visually and in terms of mean squared error.<\/div>","canEdit":false,"isAdmin":false,"isArtifact":false,"showFullAbstract":false,"widgetId":"rgw17_56ab1c23636bd"},"id":"rgw17_56ab1c23636bd","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationAbstract.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":[],"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationAbstract.html?publicationUid=5606886","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationAbstractView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationAbstractView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"publicationKeywords":null,"publicationState":null,"isGuest":true,"isAdminEditingAllowed":false,"isArtifact":false,"figureListWidget":{"data":{"figures":[{"imageUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Eero_Simoncelli\/publication\/5606886\/figure\/fig1\/Fig-6-Comparison-of-denoising-results-on-Barbara-image-cropped-to-150-2-150-for.png","previewImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Eero_Simoncelli\/publication\/5606886\/figure\/fig1\/Fig-6-Comparison-of-denoising-results-on-Barbara-image-cropped-to-150-2-150-for_small.png","figureUrl":"\/figure\/5606886_fig1_Fig-6-Comparison-of-denoising-results-on-Barbara-image-cropped-to-150-2-150-for","selected":false,"title":"Fig. 6.

The first is that the probability structure may be\ndefinedlocally.Typically,onemakesaMarkovassumption,that\nthe probability density of a pixel, when conditioned on a set\nof neighbors, is independent of the pixels beyond the neigh-\nborhood. The second is an assumption of spatial homogeneity:\nthe distribution of values in a neighborhood is the same for all\nsuchneighborhoods,regardlessofabsolutespatialposition.The\nMarkovrandomfieldmodelthatresultsfromthesetwoassump-\ntions is commonly simplified by assuming the distributions are\nGaussian. This last assumption is problematic for image mod-\neling, where the complexity of local structures is not well de-\nscribed by Gaussian densities.\nThe power of statistical image models can be substantially\nimproved by transforming the signal from the pixel domain to\na new representation. Over the past decade, it has become stan-\ndard to initiate computer-vision and image processing tasks by\ndecomposing the image with a set of multiscale bandpass ori-\nented filters.This kind of representation, loosely referred to as a\nwaveletdecomposition,iseffectiveatdecouplingthehigh-order\nstatistical features of natural images. In addition, it shares some\nbasic properties of neural responses in the primary visual cortex\nof mammals which are presumably adapted to efficiently repre-\nsent the visually relevant features of images.\nA number of researchers have developed homogeneous local\nprobability models for images in multiscale oriented represen-\ntations. Specifically, the marginal distributions of wavelet co-\nefficients are highly kurtotic, and can be described using suit-\nable long-tailed distributions. Recent work has investigated the\ndependencies between coefficients, and found that the ampli-\ntudes of coefficients of similar position, orientation and scale\nare highly correlated. These higher order dependencies, as well\nas the higher order marginal statistics, may be modeled by aug-\nmentingasimpleparametricmodelforlocaldependencies(e.g.,\nGaussian) with a set of \u201chidden\u201d random variables that govern\nthe parameters (e.g., variance). Such hidden Markov models\nhave become widely used, for example, in speech processing.\nIn this article, we develop a model for neighborhoods of ori-\nented pyramid coefficients based on a Gaussian scale mixture\n[1]: the product of a Gaussian random vector, and an inde-\npendent hidden random scalar multiplier. We have previously\ndemonstrated that this model can account for both marginal\nand pairwise joint distributions of wavelet coefficients [2], [3].\nHere, we develop a local denoising solution as a Bayesian\nleast squares estimator, and demonstrate the performance of\nthis method on images corrupted by simulated additive white\nGaussian noise of known variance.\n1057-7149\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE"},{"page":2,"text":"PORTILLA et al.: IMAGE DENOISING USING SCALE MIXTURES OF GAUSSIANS IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN1339\nI. BACKGROUND: STATISTICAL IMAGE\nMODELS AND DENOISING\nContemporary models of image statistics are rooted in the\ntelevision engineering of the 1950s (see [4] for review), which\nrelied on a characterization of the autocovariance function for\npurposesofoptimalsignalrepresentationandtransmission.This\nwork,andnearlyallworksince,assumesthatimagestatisticsare\nspatially homogeneous (i.e., strict-sense stationary). Another\ncommon assumption in image modeling is that the statistics\nare invariant, when suitably normalized, to changes in spatial\nscale. The translation- and scale-invariance assumptions, cou-\npled with an assumption of Gaussianity, provides the baseline\nmodel found throughout the engineering literature: images are\nsamples of a Gaussian random field, with variance falling as\nin thefrequency domain. In thecontext ofdenoising, if one\nassumes the noise is additive and independent of the signal, and\nis also a Gaussian sample, then the optimal estimator is linear.\nA. Modeling Non-Gaussian Image Properties\nIn recent years, models have been developed to account for\nnon-Gaussian behaviors of image statistics. One can see from\ncasual observation that individual images are highly inhomo-\ngeneous: they typically contain many regions that are smooth,\ninterspersed with \u201cfeatures\u201d such as contours, or surface mark-\nings. This is reflected in the observed marginal distributions of\nbandpass filter responses, which show a large peak at zero, and\ntails that fall significantly slower than a Gaussian of the same\nvariance [5]\u2013[7] [see Fig. 1(a)]. When one seeks a linear trans-\nformation that maximizes the non-Gaussianity1of the marginal\nresponses, the result is a basis set of bandpass oriented filters of\ndifferent sizes spanning roughly an octave in bandwidth, e.g.,\n[8], [9].\nDuetothecombinationofthesequalitativeproperties,aswell\nas an elegant mathematical framework, multiscale oriented sub-\nband decompositions have emerged as the representations of\nchoice for many image processing applications. Within the sub-\nbands of these representations, the kurtotic behaviors of coeffi-\ncientsallowonetoremovenoiseusingapointnonlinearity.Such\napproaches have become quite popular in the image denoising\nliterature, and typically are chosen to perform a type of thresh-\nolding operation, suppressing low-amplitude values while re-\ntaininghigh-amplitudevalues.Theconceptwasdevelopedorig-\ninally in the television engineering literature (where it is known\nas \u201ccoring,\u201d e.g., [10]), and specific shrinkage functions have\nbeenderivedunderavarietyofformulations,includingminimax\noptimality under a smoothness condition [11], [12], [57], and\nBayesian estimation with non-Gaussian priors, e.g., [13]\u2013[19],\n[58].\nIn addition to the non-Gaussian marginal behavior, the re-\nsponsesofbandpassfiltersexhibitimportantnon-Gaussianjoint\nstatistical behavior. In particular, even when they are second-\norder decorrelated, the coefficients corresponding to pairs of\nbasis functions of similar position, orientation and scale ex-\nhibit striking dependencies [20], [21].

The condi-\ntional histograms of pairs of coefficients indicates that the stan-\ndard deviation of a coefficient scales roughly linearly with the\namplitude of nearby coefficients [2], [21], [22] [see Fig. 1(c)].\nThedependencybetweenlocalcoefficientamplitudes,aswell\nas the associated marginal behaviors, can be modeled using a\nrandomfieldwithaspatiallyfluctuatingvariance.Aparticularly\nuseful example arisesfrom the productof a Gaussian vectorand\na hidden scalar multiplier, known as a Gaussian scale mixture\n[1] (GSM). GSM distributions represent an important subset\nof the elliptically symmetric distributions, which are those that\ncan be defined as functions of a quadratic norm of the random\nvector. Embedded in a random field, these kinds of models have\nbeen found useful in the speech-processing community [23].\nA related set of models, known as autoregressive conditional\nheteroskedastic (ARCH) models, e.g., [24], have proven useful\nfor many real signals that suffer from abrupt fluctuations, fol-\nlowed by relative \u201ccalm\u201d periods (stock market prices, for ex-\nample). These kinds of ideas have also been found effective in\ndescribingvisualimages.Forexample,Baraniukandcolleagues\nused a 2-state hidden multiplier variable to characterize the two\nmodesofbehaviorcorrespondingtosmoothorlow-contrasttex-\ntured regions and features [25], [26]. Our own work, as well as\nthat of others, assumes that the local variance is governed by a\ncontinuous multiplier variable [2], [3], [27], [28]. This model\ncan capture the strongly leptokurtotic behavior of the marginal\ndensities of natural image wavelet coefficients, as well as the\ncorrelation in their local amplitudes, as illustrated in Fig. 1."},{"page":3,"text":"1340 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. 12, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2003\nB. Empirical Bayes Denoising Using Variance-Adaptive\nModels\nMore than20yearsago,Lee[29] suggesteda two-stepproce-\ndure for image denoising, in which one first estimates the local\nsignal variance from a neighborhood of observed pixels, and\nthen (proceeding as if this were the true variance) applies the\nstandard linear least squares (LLS) solution. This method is a\ntype of empirical Bayes estimator [30], in that a parameter of\nthe local model is first estimated from the data, and this esti-\nmate is subsequently used to estimate the signal. This two-step\ndenoising solution can be applied to any of the variance-adap-\ntive models described in Section I-A, and is substantially more\npowerful when applied in a multiscale oriented representation.\nSpecifically, a number of authors have estimated the local vari-\nance from a collection of wavelet coefficients at nearby posi-\ntions, scales, and\/or orientations, and then used these estimated\nvariances in order to denoise the coefficients [16], [21], [28],\n[31]\u2013[33].\nSolutions based on GSM models, with different prior as-\nsumptions about the hidden variables, have produced some of\nthe most effective methods for removing homogeneous additive\nnoise from natural images to date. Our initial work in this\narea developed a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator [34].\nMih\u00e7ak et al. used a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator\nbased on an exponential marginal prior [28], as did Li and\nOrchard [35], whereas Portilla et al. used a lognormal prior\n[36]. Wainwright et al. developed a tree-structured Markov\nmodel to provide a global description for the set of multiplier\nvariables [3]. Despite these successes, the two-step empirical\nBayes approach is suboptimal, even when the local variance\nestimator is optimal, because the second step does not take into\naccount the uncertainty associated with the variance estimated\nin the first step. In this paper, we derive a least squares optimal\nsingle-step Bayesian estimator.\nII. IMAGE PROBABILITY MODEL\nAs described in Section I, multiscale representations provide\na useful front-end for representing the structures of visual\nimages. But the widely used orthonormal or biorthogonal\nwavelet representations are problematic for many applications,\nincluding denoising. Specifically, they are critically sampled\n(the number of coefficients is equal to the number of image\npixels), and this constraint leads to disturbing visual artifacts\n(i.e., \u201caliasing\u201d or \u201cringing\u201d). A widely followed solution to\nthis problem is to use basis functionsdesigned for orthogonal or\nbiorthogonal systems, but to reduce or eliminate the decimation\nof the subbands, e.g., [37].\nOnce the constraint of critical sampling has been dropped,\nhowever, there is no need to limit oneself to these basis func-\ntions. Significant improvement comes from the use of repre-\nsentations with a higher degree of redundancy, as well as in-\ncreased selectivity in orientation [16], [19], [34], [38]. For the\ncurrent paper, we have used a particular variant of an overcom-\nplete tight frame representation known as a steerable pyramid\n[38], [39]. The basis functions of this multiscale linear decom-\nposition are spatially localized, oriented, and span roughly one\noctaveinbandwidth.Theyarepolar-separableintheFourierdo-\nmain,andarerelatedbytranslation,dilation,androtation.Other\nauthors have developed representations with similar properties\n[19], [40]\u2013[42]. Details of the steerable pyramid representation\nare provided in Appendix A.\nA. Gaussian Scale Mixtures\nConsider an image decomposed into oriented subbands\nat multiple scales. We denote as\ncorresponding to a linear basis function at scale , orientation\n, and centered at spatial location\na neighborhood of coefficients clustered around\nthis reference coefficient2. In general, the neighborhood may\ninclude coefficients from other subbands (i.e., corresponding\nto basis functions at nearby scales and orientations), as well as\nfrom the same subband. In our case, we use a neighborhood\nof coefficients drawn from two subbands at adjacent scales,\nthus taking advantage of the strong statistical coupling ob-\nserved through scale in multiscale representations. Details are\nprovided in Section IV.\nWe assume the coefficients within each local neighborhood\naround a reference coefficient of a pyramid subband are charac-\nterized by a Gaussian scale mixture (GSM) model. Formally, a\nrandom vector\nis a Gaussian scale mixture [1] if and only if it\ncan be expressed as the product of a zero-mean Gaussian vector\nand an independent positive scalar random variable\nthe coefficient\n.

GSM Model for the Wavelet Coefficients\nAs explained in Section I and illustrated in Fig. 1, a GSM\nmodel can account for both the shape of wavelet coefficient\nmarginals and the strong correlation between the amplitudes\nof neighbor coefficients [2], [3]. In order to construct a global\nmodel for images from this local description, one must specify\nboth the neighborhood structure of the coefficients, and the dis-\ntribution of the multipliers. The definition of (and calculations\nusing) the global model is considerably simplified by parti-\ntioning the coefficients into nonoverlapping neighborhoods.\nOne can then specify either a marginal model for the multipliers\n(treating them as independent variables) [43], or specify a joint\ndensity over the full set of multipliers [3]. Unfortunately, the\nuse of disjoint neighborhoods leads to noticeable denoising\nartifacts at the discontinuities introduced by the neighborhood\nboundaries.\nAnalternativeapproachistouseaGSMasalocaldescription\nof the behavior of the cluster of coefficients centered at each co-\nefficient in the pyramid. Since the neighborhoods overlap, each\ncoefficient will be a member of many neighborhoods. The local\nmodel implicitlydefines a global(Markov) model, described by\nthe conditional density of a coefficient in the cluster given its\nsurroundingneighborhood,assumingconditionalindependence\non the rest of the coefficients. But the structure of the resulting\nmodel is such that performing statistical inference (i.e., com-\nputing Bayes estimates) in an exact way is quite challenging.\nIn this paper, we simply solve the estimation problem for the\nreference coefficient at the center of each neighborhood inde-\npendently.\nC. Prior Density for Multiplier\nTo complete the model, we need to specify the probability\ndensity,\n, of the multiplier. Several authors have sug-\ngested the generalized Gaussian (stretched exponential) family\nof densities as an appropriate description of wavelet coefficient\nmarginal densities [7], [13], [17]:\nwhere the scaling variable controls the width of the distribu-\ntion, and the exponent\ncontrols the shape (in particular, the\nheaviness of the tails), and is typically estimated to lie in the\nrange\nfor image subbands. Although these can be ex-\npressed as GSM\u2019s, the density of the associated multiplier has\nno closed form expression, and thus this solution is difficult to\nimplement.\nIn previous work [36], we noted that for the case\nthe density of the log coefficient magnitude,\nwritten as a convolution of the densities of\nSince the density of\nis known, this means that estimation\nof the density of\nmay be framed as a deconvolution\nproblem. The resulting estimated density may be approximated\nbyaGaussian,correspondingtoalognormalpriorforthe .This\nsolution has two important drawbacks. First, it is only extrapo-\nlable to the\ncase when all the neighbors have the same\nmarginal statistics, which, in practice requires they all belong to\nthe same subband. Second, it is estimated from the noise-free\ncoefficients, and it is difficult to extend it for use in the noisy\ncase.\n,\n, may be\nand.\nWe have also investigated a more direct maximum likeli-\nhood approach for estimating a nonparametric\nobserved set of neighborhood vectors\nfrom an\n(3)\nwherethesumisovertheneighborhoods.Notethattheestimate,\n,mustbeconstrainedtopositivevalues,andmusthaveunit\narea. We have developed an efficient algorithm for computing\nthis solution numerically. One advantage of the ML solution is\nthat it is easily extended for use with the noisy observations, by\nreplacing\nwith the noisy observation.\nA fourth choice is a so-called noninformative prior [44],\nwhich has the advantage that it does not require the fitting of\nany parameters to the noisy observation.

IMAGE DENOISING\nOur procedure for image denoising uses the same top-level\nstructure as most previously published approaches: 1) decom-\npose the image into pyramid subbands at different scales and\norientations; 2) denoise each subband, except for the lowpass\nresidualband;and3)invertthepyramidtransform,obtainingthe\ndenoised image.

IMPLEMENTATION\nWe decompose the image into subbands using a specialized\nvariant of the steerable pyramid. The representation consists\nof oriented bandpass bands at 8 orientations and 5 scales, 8\noriented highpass residual subbands, and one lowpass (nonori-\nented) residual band, for a total of 49 subbands. A detailed de-\nscription of the decomposition is given in Appendix A.\nWe have hand-optimized the neighborhood structure (i.e.,\nchoice of spatial positions, scales and orientations). A 3\n3\nregion surrounding the reference coefficient, together with the\ncoefficientatthesamelocationandorientationatthenextcoarser\nscale (the parent), maximizes the denoising performance, on\naverage. Inclusion of parent coefficient has been found to\nprovide a significant improvement in performance in a number\nof applications, e.g., [21], [22], [25], [26], [46]. Note that\nsince the parent subband is sampled at half the density of\nthe reference subband, it must be upsampled and interpolated\nin order to obtain values for neighborhoods at every choice\nof reference coefficient. Two exceptions must be applied:\n1) the highpass oriented subbands, whose parents have the\nsame number of samples as them (no interpolation is required\nfor those parents); and 2) the subbands at the coarsest scale,\nwhich have no parent subband (we simply use the 3\nneighborhood for those subbands). Note that in terms of image\npixels, the spatial extent of the neighborhood depends on the\nscale of the subband (the basis functions grow in size as\nas is appropriate under the assumption that image statistics are\nscale-invariant [47], [48].\nIn our implementation, the integral of (8) is computed nu-\nmerically. The range and sample spacing for this integration are\nchosen as a compromise between accuracy and computational\ncost.

Comparison to Model Variants\nIn order to understand the relative contribution of various as-\npects of our method, we considered two restricted versions of\nour model that are representative of the two primary denoising\nconcepts found in the literature. The first is a Gaussian model,\narising from the restriction of our model to a prior density\nwhich is a delta function concentrated at one. This model is not\nvariance-adaptive,and,thus,isgloballyGaussian.Note,though,\nthat the signal covariance is modeled only locally (over the ex-\ntent of the neighborhood) for each pyramid subband. As such,\nthis denoising solution may be viewed as a regularized version\nof the classical linear (Wiener filter) solution. In order to imple-\nment this, we simply estimate each coefficient using (12), with\nset to one.\nThesecond restricted form of ourmodel usesa neighborhood\ncontaining only the reference coefficient (i.e., 1\nthese conditions, the model describes only the marginal density\nof the coefficients, and the estimator reduces to application of a\nscalar function to the observed noisy coefficients. The function\nresulting from the reduction of our model to a single-element\nneighborhood is shown in Fig. 2(a). This is similar to the BLS\nsolutions derived in [13], [16] for a generalized Gaussian prior,\nexcept that it is independent of the clean signal statistics, and\nits normalized form\nscales with the noise standard\ndeviation of the subband,\n(as in [11]).\nIt is also instructive to examine the nonlinear estimator asso-\nciated with the case of two neighbors.

Loosely speaking, the refer-\nencecoefficientissuppressedonlywhenbothitsownamplitude\nand the parent\u2019s amplitude are small. Adjacent neighbors in the\nsame subband have a similar effect on the estimation. Sendur\nand Selesnick have recently developed a MAP estimator based\non a circular-symmetric Laplacian density model for a coeffi-\ncient and its parent [49], [50]. Their resulting shrinkage func-\ntion is qualitatively similar to that of Fig. 2(b), except that ours\nis smoother and, due to covariance adaptation, its \u201cdead zone\u201d\nis not necessary aligned with the input axes.\nFig. 3(a) shows a comparison of our full model and the two\nreduced forms explained above. Note that the 1-D shrinkage\nsolution outperforms the jointly Gaussian (nonadaptive) solu-\ntion, which still provides relatively good results, especially at\nlow SNR rates. The full model (adaptive and context-sensitive)\nincorporates the advantages of the two subcases, and thus out-\nperforms both of them.\nWe have also examined the relative importance of other as-\npects of our method. Table II shows the decrease in PSNR that\nresults when each of a set of features is removed. The first\nthree columns correspond to features of the representation, the\nnext two to features of the model, and the last to the estimation\nmethod. Within the first group, decreasing the number of orien-\ntation bands from\nto(Ori8) leads to a significant\ndrop in performance. We havealso found that further increasing\nthe number of orientations leads to additional PSNR improve-\nment, at the expense of considerable computational and storage\ncost. The second column (OrHPR) shows the effect of not par-\ntitioning the highpass residual band into oriented components\n(the standard form of the pyramid, as used in our previous de-\nnoising work [34], [36], has only a single nonoriented highpass\nresidual band). The third column (Bdry) shows the reduction in\nperformance that results when switching from mirror-reflected\nextension to periodic boundary handling.\nThe first feature of the model we examined is the inclusion\nof the coarse-scale parent coefficient in the neighborhood.

Comparison to Standard Methods\nWe have compared our method to two well-known and\nwidely-available denoising algorithms: a local variance-adap-\ntive method in the pixel domain [29] (as implemented by the\nMatlab function wiener2), and a hard thresholding method\nusing an undecimated representation [37] with five scales based\non the minimum-phase Daubechies 8-tap wavelet filter. In both\ncases, a single parameter (the neighborhood size or a common\nthreshold for all the subbands) was optimized independently for\neach image at each noise level. Results are shown in Fig. 3(b).\nOur method is seen to clearly outperform the other two over the\nentire range of noise levels. We also see the superiority of the\ntwo multiscale methods over the pixel-domain method. Fig. 4\nprovides a visual comparison of example images denoised\nusing these two algorithms. Our method produces artifacts that\nare significantly less visible, and at the same time is able to\nbetter preserve the features of the original image.\nIt is natural to ask to what extent the results in the previous\ncomparison are due to the representation (steerable pyramid) as\nopposedtotheestimationmethoditself(BLS-GSM).Inorderto\nanswer this, we have performed two more sets of experiments,\ncomparing the performance of different combinations of repre-\nsentation and estimator. First, we have applied the two estima-\ntion methods used in Fig. 3(b) to the coefficients of the steer-\nable pyramid representation. For the adaptive Wiener method\n[29], we have found that the hand-optimized neighborhood size\nwithin the subbands is roughly 19\nthepixeldomain.Forthetranslationinvarianthard-thresholding\nmethod [37], we have optimized a common threshold for each\nimage and noise level (note that the steerable pyramid subband\nimpulse responses are not normalized in energy, so the common\nthreshold needs to be properly re-scaled for each subband). Re-\nsults are plotted in Fig. 3(c). It is clear that the use of the new\nrepresentation improves the results and reduces the difference\nbetween the methods. The adaptive Wiener method is even seen\nto outperform ours at very high input SNR\u2019s. But significant\ndifferences in performance remain, and these are due entirely to\nthe use of the BLS-GSM estimation method.\nIn a second experiment, we compared the performance of\nour estimation method when applied to coefficients of two dif-\n19\u2014much larger than in\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.\nfor visibility of the artifacts).

From left to right and top to bottom: Original\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented a denoising method based on a local\nGaussian scale mixture model in an overcomplete oriented\npyramid representation. Our statistical model differs from\nprevious models in a number of important ways. First, many\npreviousmodelshavebeenbasedoneitherseparableorthogonal\nwavelets, or redundant versions of such wavelets. In contrast,\nour model is based on an overcomplete tight frame that is free\nfromaliasing,andthatincludesbasisfunctionsthatareselective\nfor oblique orientations. The increased redundancy of the rep-\nresentation and the higher ability to discriminate orientations\nresults in improved performance. Second, our model explicitly\nincorporates the covariance between neighboring coefficients\n(for both signal and noise), as opposed to considering only\nmarginal responses or local variance. Thus, the model captures\ncorrelations induced by the overcomplete representation as\nwell as correlations inherent in the underlying image, and it\ncan handle Gaussian noise of arbitrary power spectral density.\nThird, we have included a neighbor from the same orientation\nand spatial location at a coarser scale (a parent), as opposed to\nconsidering only spatial neighbors within each subband. This\nmodeling choice is consistent with the empirical findings of\nstrong statistical dependence across scale in natural images,\ne.g., [4], [46]. Note, however, that the inclusion of the parent\nresults in only a modest increase in performance compared to\nthe other elements shown in Table II. We believe the impact of\nincluding a parent is limited by the simplicity of our model,\nwhich only characterizes the correlation of the coefficients and\nthe correlation of their amplitudes (see below).\nIn addition to these modeling differences, there are also dif-\nferences between our denoising method and previous methods\nbased on continuous hidden-variable models [3], [28], [32],\n[34], [36]. First, we compute the full optimal local Bayesian\nleast squares solution, as opposed to first estimating the local\nvariance, and then using this to estimate the coefficient. We\nhave shown empirically that this approach yields an important\nimprovement in the results. Also, we use the vectorial form of\ntheLLS solution(9),so takingfulladvantageoftheinformation\nprovided by the covariance modeling of signal and noise. These\nenhancements, together with a convenient choice for the prior\nof the hidden multiplier (a noninformative prior, independent\nof the observed signal), result in a substantial improvement\nin the quality of the denoised images, while keeping the\ncomputational cost reasonably low.\nWe are currently working on several extensions of the\nestimator presented here. First, we have begun developing\na variant of this method to denoise color images taken with\na commercial digital camera [53]. We find that the sensor\nnoise of such cameras has two important features that must\nbe characterized through calibration measurements: spatial\nand cross-channel correlation, and signal-dependence. We are\nalso extending the denoising solution to address the complete\nimage restoration problem, by incorporating a model of image\nblur [54]. Finally, we are developing an ML estimator for the\nnoise variance, when the normalized power spectral density"},{"page":12,"text":"PORTILLA et al.: IMAGE DENOISING USING SCALE MIXTURES OF GAUSSIANS IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN1349\nFig. 7.\nof highpass oriented bands. The lowpass band is then split into a lower-frequency band and a set of oriented subbands.

(b) Basis function corresponding to an example oriented subband, and idealized\ndepiction of the frequency domain partition ?? ? ??? ? ??, with gray region corresponding to this basis function.\n(a) System diagram for the extended version of the steerable pyramid used in this paper [38]. The input image is first split into a lowpass band and a set\nof the noise is assumed known. Preliminary results of these\nextensions appear very promising.\nWe believe that the current image model can be improved in\na number of ways. It would be desirable to develop a method\nfor efficiently estimating a prior for the multiplier by maxi-\nmizing the joint likelihood of the observed subbands, as op-\nposed to the somewhat heuristic choice of noninformative prior\n(corrected at the origin) we have presented. Similarly, it would\nalso be desirable to minimize the expected quadratic error in\nthe image domain, instead of doing it for the subband coeffi-\ncients. In addition, it is worth exploring the transformation of\nthe local GSM model into an explicit Markov model with over-\nlapping neighborhoods, as opposed to the nonoverlapping tree-\nstructured models previously developed [3], [25]. This concep-\ntual simplification would facilitate other applications requiring\na conditional local density model (e.g., synthesis or coding). Fi-\nnally, from a longer-term perspective, major improvements are\nlikely to come from statistical models that capture important\nstructural properties of local image features, by including addi-\ntional dependencies such as phase congruency between the co-\nefficients of complex multiscale oriented transforms, e.g., [55],\n[56].\nAPPENDIX A\nSTEERABLE PYRAMID\nWe use a transform known as a steerable pyramid [38],\n[39] to decompose images into frequency subbands. The\ntransform is implemented in the Fourier domain, allowing\nexact reconstruction of the image from the subbands, as well\nas a flexible choice of the number of orientations\nscales\n. A software implementation (in Matlab) is avail-\nable at http:\/\/www.cns.nyu.edu\/~lcv\/software.html. As with\nconventional orthogonal wavelet decompositions, the pyramid\nis implemented by recursively splitting an image into a set of\noriented subbands, and a lowpass residual band which is sub-\nsampledbyafactoroftwoalongbothaxes.Unlikeconventional\nand\northogonal wavelet decompositions, the oriented bands are not\nsubsampled, and the subsampling of the lowpass band does\nnot produce aliasing artifacts, as the lowpass filter is designed\nto obey the Nyquist sampling criterion. When performing\nconvolutions, the boundaries are handled by mirror extension\n(reflection) of the image, thereby maintaining continuity. Since\nit is a tight frame, the transformation may be inverted by con-\nvolving each subband with its associated complex-conjugated\nfilter and adding the results.

In particular,\nthe use of image nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior,\nwhich refers to the fact that a local patch often has many\nnonlocal similar patches to it across the image, has significantly\nenhanced the denoising performance. However, in\nmost existing methods only the NSS of input degraded image\nis exploited, while how to utilize the NSS of clean natural\nimages is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose\na patch group (PG) based NSS prior learning scheme\nto learn explicit NSS models from natural images for high\nperformance denoising. PGs are extracted from training\nimages by putting nonlocal similar patches into groups, and\na PG based Gaussian Mixture Model (PG-GMM) learning\nalgorithm is developed to learn the NSS prior. We demonstrate\nthat, owe to the learned PG-GMM, a simple weighted\nsparse coding model, which has a closed-form solution, can\nbe used to perform image denoising effectively, resulting in\nhigh PSNR measure, fast speed, and particularly the best\nvisual quality among all competing methods.","description":false,"swapJournalAndAuthorPositions":false,"showAbstract":true,"type":"Conference Paper","showType":true,"showPublicationIcon":false,"showSeeInContextCta":false,"publicationUrlWithContext":"publication\/284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising","isReader":null,"isAuthor":null,"isRequester":false,"hasFulltext":true,"actions":[{"type":"download","text":"Download","url":"profile\/Jun_Xu81\/publication\/284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising\/links\/564b1dad08ae295f64513559.pdf?origin=publication_list","active":false,"primary":true,"extraClass":"open-viewer","icon":null,"data":[]}],"actionWidgets":[],"publicationItemFulltext":{"data":{"isDataset":false,"isResearch":false,"isFulltext":true,"source":{"isPreview":false,"sourceUrl":"profile\/Jun_Xu81","sourceName":"Jun Xu","hasSourceUrl":true},"publicationUid":284028271,"publicationUrl":"publication\/284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising","eventCode":"","citationCount":0,"additionalContentWidgets":[],"disableViewer":true,"showLoggedOutRequestButton":false,"context":null,"previewUrl":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising\/links\/564b1dad08ae295f64513559\/smallpreview.png","linkId":"564b1dad08ae295f64513559","origin":"publication_list","showRequestCount":false,"publish":false,"request":false,"showAction":false,"displayAsLink":true,"documentViewerUrl":"publicliterature.PublicLiteratureDocumentViewer.html?publicationId=284028271&reference=564b1dad08ae295f64513559&eventCode=&origin=publication_list","widgetId":"rgw35_56ab1c23636bd"},"id":"rgw35_56ab1c23636bd","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationItemFulltext.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltext.html?publicationUid=284028271&showAction=1&eventCode=&hideSource=0&displayAsLink=1&showPublishAsSelectFile=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"linkId":"564b1dad08ae295f64513559","context":null,"contextId":null,"eventCode":"","isCitation":true,"isPendingCitationRequest":false,"canRemoveCitation":false,"citationSourcePublicationUid":5606886,"publicationCitationUid":false,"showPublicationDownloadDataUsagePermissionDialog":false,"origin":"publication_list","keywordList":null,"hasKeywordList":false,"showOpenReviewButton":false,"openReviewUrl":"publication\/284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising\/review","additionalRightSideTopWidgets":[{"data":{"citationContexts":["Chang et al. modeled the wavelet transform coefficients as generalized Gaussian distribution, and proposed the BayesShrink [6] algorithm.

Our formulation of a L2-relaxed L0 pseudonorm prior allows for an especially simple MAP estimation iterative marginal optimization algorithm, whose convergence we prove. We achieve a significant speed-up over the direct (static) solution by using dynamically evolving parameters through the estimation loop. As an added heuristic twist, we fix in advance the number of iterations, and then empirically optimize the involved parameters according to two performance benchmarks. The resulting constrained dynamic method is not just fast and effective, it is also highly robust and flexible. First, it is able to provide an outstanding trade-off between computational load and performance, in visual and objective -MSE, SSIM- terms, for a large variety of degradation tests, using the same set of parameter values for all tests. Second, the performance benchmark can be easily adapted to specific types of degradation, image classes, and even performance criteria. Third, it allows for using simultaneously several dictionaries with complementary features. This unique combination makes ours a highly practical deconvolution method.","description":false,"swapJournalAndAuthorPositions":false,"showAbstract":true,"type":"Article","showType":true,"showPublicationIcon":false,"showSeeInContextCta":false,"publicationUrlWithContext":"publication\/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors","isReader":null,"isAuthor":null,"isRequester":false,"hasFulltext":true,"actions":[{"type":"download","text":"Download","url":"profile\/Javier_Portilla2\/publication\/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors\/links\/564d97e508aeafc2aaaff41b.pdf?origin=publication_list","active":false,"primary":true,"extraClass":"open-viewer","icon":null,"data":[]}],"actionWidgets":[],"publicationItemFulltext":{"data":{"isDataset":false,"isResearch":false,"isFulltext":true,"source":{"isPreview":false,"sourceUrl":"profile\/Javier_Portilla2","sourceName":"Javier Portilla","hasSourceUrl":true},"publicationUid":282046488,"publicationUrl":"publication\/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors","eventCode":"","citationCount":0,"additionalContentWidgets":[],"disableViewer":true,"showLoggedOutRequestButton":false,"context":null,"previewUrl":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors\/links\/564d97e508aeafc2aaaff41b\/smallpreview.png","linkId":"564d97e508aeafc2aaaff41b","origin":"publication_list","showRequestCount":false,"publish":false,"request":false,"showAction":false,"displayAsLink":true,"documentViewerUrl":"publicliterature.PublicLiteratureDocumentViewer.html?publicationId=282046488&reference=564d97e508aeafc2aaaff41b&eventCode=&origin=publication_list","widgetId":"rgw38_56ab1c23636bd"},"id":"rgw38_56ab1c23636bd","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationItemFulltext.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltext.html?publicationUid=282046488&showAction=1&eventCode=&hideSource=0&displayAsLink=1&showPublishAsSelectFile=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"linkId":"564d97e508aeafc2aaaff41b","context":null,"contextId":null,"eventCode":"","isCitation":true,"isPendingCitationRequest":false,"canRemoveCitation":false,"citationSourcePublicationUid":5606886,"publicationCitationUid":false,"showPublicationDownloadDataUsagePermissionDialog":false,"origin":"publication_list","keywordList":null,"hasKeywordList":false,"showOpenReviewButton":false,"openReviewUrl":"publication\/282046488_Efficient_and_Robust_Image_Restoration_Using_Multiple-Feature_L2-Relaxed_Sparse_Analysis_Priors\/review","additionalRightSideTopWidgets":[{"data":{"citationContexts":["More recently, we are witnessing a convergence of \" the best of both worlds \" of sparsity in redundant dictionaries and non-local redundancy, with highly impressive results for restoration [14]\u2013[17].
