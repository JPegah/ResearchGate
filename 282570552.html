Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to<br />be smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that<br />can be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization<br />problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in both the Bayesian and<br />the multi-objective optimization literatures. More specifically, we construct a loss function based on an<br />extended domination rule to handle the objectives and the constraints simultaneously. Then, we derive<br />a corresponding (Bayesian) expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion. This new sampling<br />criterion makes it possible to build an optimization algorithm that can start without any feasible point.<br />The new sampling criterion reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteriaâthe classical Expected Im-<br />provement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective extensionsâas soon as at least one<br />feasible point is available. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequen-<br />tial Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset simulation method, which<br />is well known in the field of structural reliability, is used to estimate the expected hyper-volume im-<br />provement criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization), is<br />compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for single-objective and multi-objective constrained optimization<br />problems.<br />Keywords Bayesian optimization Â· Expected improvement Â· Kriging Â· Gaussian process Â· Multi-<br />Objective Â· Sequential Monte Carlo Â· Subset simulation<br />1 Introduction<br />This article addresses the problem of derivative-free multi-objective optimization of real-valued functions<br />subject to multiple inequality constraints. The problem consists in finding an approximation of the set<br />Î = {x â X : c(x) â¤ 0 and ?x?â X such that f(x?) âº f(x)}<br />where X â Rdis the search domain, c = (ci)1â¤iâ¤q is a vector of constraint functions (ci : X â R),<br />c(x) â¤ 0 means that ci(x) â¤ 0 for all 1 â¤ i â¤ q, f = (fj)1â¤jâ¤p is a vector of objective functions<br />to be minimized (fj : X â R), and âº denotes the Pareto domination rule (see, e.g., Fonseca and<br />Fleming, 1998). Both the objective functions fj and the constraint functions ci are assumed to be<br />(1)<br />Paul Feliot (Ph.D. student) â E-mail: paul.feliot@irt-systemx.fr<br />Institut de Recherche Technologique SystemX, Palaiseau, France.<br />Julien Bect &amp; Emmanuel Vazquez â E-mail: firstname.lastname@centralesupelec.fr<br />Laboratoire des Signaux et SystÃ¨mes, Gif-sur-Yvette, France</p>  <p>Page 3</p> <p>2<br />continuous. The search domain X is assumed to be compactâtypically, X is a hyper-rectangle defined<br />by bound constraints. Moreover, the objective and constraint functions are regarded as black boxes<br />and, in particular, we assume that no gradient information is available. Finally, the objective and the<br />constraint functions are assumed to be expensive to evaluate, which arises for instance when the values<br />f(x) and c(x), for a given x â X, correspond to the outputs of a computationally expensive computer<br />program. In this setting, the emphasis is on building optimization algorithms that perform well under a<br />very limited budget of evaluations (e.g., a few hundred evaluations).<br />We adopt a Bayesian approach to this optimization problem. The essence of Bayesian optimization is to<br />choose a prior model for the expensive-to-evaluate function(s) involved in the optimization problemâ<br />usually a Gaussian process model (Santner et al., 2003; Williams and Rasmussen, 2006) for tractabilityâ<br />and then to select the evaluation points sequentially in order to obtain a small average error between the<br />approximation obtained by the optimization algorithm and the optimal solution, under the selected prior.<br />See, e.g., Kushner (1964); Mockus (1975); Mockus et al. (1978); Archetti and BetrÃ² (1979) and Mockus<br />(1989) for some of the earliest references in the field. Bayesian optimization research was first focused<br />on the case of single-objective bound-constrained optimization: the Expected Improvement (EI) crite-<br />rion (Mockus et al., 1978; Jones et al., 1998) has emerged in this case as one of the most popular criteria<br />for selecting evaluation points. Later, the EI criterion has been extended to handle constraints (Schonlau<br />et al., 1998; Sasena et al., 2002; Gramacy and Lee, 2011; Gelbart et al., 2014; Gramacy et al., to appear)<br />and to address bound-constrained multi-objective problems (Emmerich et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2006;<br />Wagner et al., 2010; Svenson and Santner, 2010).<br />The contribution of this article is twofold. The first part of the contribution is the proposition of a<br />new sampling criterion that handles multiple objectives and non-linear constraints simultaneously. This<br />criterion corresponds to a one-step look-ahead Bayesian strategy, using the dominated hyper-volume as a<br />utility function (following in this respect Emmerich et al., 2006). More specifically, the dominated hyper-<br />volume is defined using an extended domination rule, which handles both the objectives and constraints<br />jointly (in the spirit of Fonseca and Fleming, 1998; Ray et al., 2001; Oyama et al., 2007). Our new criterion<br />is naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and several criteria from<br />the literatureâthe EI criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective extensionsâare recovered<br />as special cases when at least one feasible point is known. The second part of the contribution lies in the<br />numerical methods employed to compute and optimize the sampling criterion. Indeed, this criterion takes<br />the form of an integral over the space of constraints and objectives, for which no analytical expression is<br />available in the general case. Besides, it must be optimized at each iteration of the algorithm to determine<br />the next evaluation point. In order to compute the integral, we use an algorithm similar to the subset<br />simulation method (Au and Beck, 2001; CÃ©rou et al., 2012), which is a well known Sequential Monte<br />Carlo (SMC) technique (see Del Moral et al., 2006; Liu, 2008, and references therein) from the field of<br />structural reliability and rare event estimation. For the optimization of the criterion, we resort to an SMC<br />method as well, following earlier work by Benassi et al. (2012) for single-objective bound-constrained<br />problems. The resulting algorithm is called BMOO (for Bayesian multi-objective optimization).<br />The structure of the article is as follows. In Section 2, we recall the framework of Bayesian optimization<br />based on the expected improvement sampling criterion, starting with the unconstrained single-objective<br />setting. Section 3 presents our new sampling criterion for constrained multi-objective optimization. The<br />calculation and the optimization of the criterion are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents experimen-<br />tal results. An illustration on a two-dimensional toy problem is proposed for visualization purpose. Then,<br />the performances of the method are compared to those of reference methods on both single-objective and<br />multi-objective constrained optimization problems from the literature. Finally, future work is discussed<br />in Section 6.</p>  <p>Page 4</p> <p>3<br />2 Background literature<br />2.1 Expected Improvement<br />Consider the single-objective unconstrained optimization problem<br />x?= argminxâXf(x),<br />where f is a continuous real-valued function defined over X â Rd. Our objective is to find an approxima-<br />tion of x?using a sequence of evaluation points X1, X2, ... â X. Because the choice of a new evaluation<br />point Xn+1at iteration n depends on the evaluation results of f at X1, ..., Xn, the construction of an<br />optimization strategy X : f ?â (X1, X2, X3...) is a sequential decision problem.<br />The Bayesian approach to this decision problem originates from the early work of Kushner (1964)<br />and Mockus et al. (1978). Assume that a loss function Îµn(X,f) has been chosen to measure the perfor-<br />mance of the strategy X on f after n evaluations, for instance the classical loss function<br />Îµn(X,f) = mnâ m,<br />(2)<br />with mn= f(X1) â§ Â·Â·Â· â§ f(Xn) and m = minxâXf(x). Then, a good strategy in the Bayesian sense<br />is a strategy that achieves, on average, a small value of Îµn(X,f) when n increases, where the average<br />is taken with respect to a stochastic process model Î¾ (defined on a probability space (Î©,A,P0), with<br />parameter in X) for the function f. In other words, the Bayesian approach assumes that f = Î¾(Ï,Â·) for<br />some Ï â Î©. The probability distribution of Î¾ represents prior knowledge about the function fâbefore<br />actual evaluations are performed. The reader is referred to Vazquez and Bect (2014) for a discussion of<br />other possible loss functions in the context of Bayesian optimization.<br />Observing that the Bayes-optimal strategy for a budget of N evaluations is intractable for N greater<br />than a few units, Mockus et al. (1978) proposed to use a one-step look-ahead strategy (also known as a<br />myopic strategy). Given n &lt; N evaluation results, the next evaluation point Xn+1is chosen in order to<br />minimize the conditional expectation of the future loss Îµn+1(X,Î¾) given available evaluation results:<br />?Îµn+1(X,Î¾) | Xn+1= x?,<br />where Enstands for the conditional expectation with respect to X1, Î¾(X1), ..., Xn, Î¾(Xn). Most of the<br />work produced in the field of Bayesian optimization since then has been focusing, as the present paper<br />will, on one-step look-ahead (or similar) strategies1; the reader is referred to Ginsbouger and Le Riche<br />(2009) and Benassi (2013) for discussions about two-step look-ahead strategies.<br />Xn+1= argminxâXEn<br />(3)<br />When (2) is used as a loss function, the right-hand side of (3) can be rewritten as<br />?Îµn+1(X,Î¾) | Xn+1= x?= argminEn<br />argminEn<br />?mn+1<br />??Xn+1= x?<br />= argmaxEn<br />?(mnâ Î¾(x))+<br />?,<br />(4)<br />with z+= max(z, 0). The function<br />Ïn(x) : x ?â En<br />?(mnâ Î¾(x))+<br />?<br />(5)<br />is called the Expected Improvement (EI) criterion (Schonlau et al., 1998; Jones et al., 1998). When Î¾ is<br />a Gaussian process with known mean and covariance functions, Ïn(x) has a closed-form expression:<br />?<br />1Mockus (1989, Section 2.5) heuristically introduces a modification of (3) to compensate for the fact that subsequent<br />evaluation results are not taken into account in the myopic strategy. In this work, we consider a purely myopic strategy as<br />in Jones et al. (1998).<br />Ïn(x) = Î³mnâ?Î¾n(x), Ï2<br />n(x)<br />?<br />,<br />(6)</p>  <p>Page 5</p> <p>4<br />where<br />Î³(z,s) =<br />?âsÏ<br />max(z,0)<br />?<br />z<br />âs<br />?<br />+ z Î¦<br />?<br />z<br />âs<br />?<br />if s &gt; 0,<br />if s = 0,<br />with Î¦ standing for the normal cumulative distribution function, Ï = Î¦?for the normal probability<br />density function,?Î¾n(x) = En(Î¾(x)) for the kriging predictor at x (the posterior mean of Î¾(x) after<br />See, e.g., the books of Stein (1999), Santner et al.

The objective function Ïn is rather<br />inexpensive to evaluate when Î¾ is a Gaussian process, using (6), but it is typically severely multi-modal.<br />A simple method to optimize Ïnconsists in choosing a fixed finite set of points that covers X reasonably<br />well and then performing a discrete search. Recently, sequential Monte Carlo techniques (see Del Moral<br />et al., 2006; Liu, 2008, and references therein) have been shown to be a valuable tool for this task (Benassi<br />et al., 2012). A review of other approaches is provided in the PhD thesis of Benassi (2013, Section 4.2).<br />2.2 EI-based multi-objective optimization without constraints<br />We now turn to the case of unconstrained multi-objective optimization. Under this framework, we con-<br />sider a set of objective functions fj : X â R, j = 1, ..., p, to be minimized, and the objective is to<br />build an approximation of the Pareto front and of the set of corresponding solutions<br />Î = {x â X : ?x?â X such that f(x?) âº f(x)},<br />(7)<br />where âº stands for the Pareto domination rule defined by<br />y = (y1, ..., yp) âº z = (z1, ..., zp) ââ<br />?âi â¤ p, yiâ¤ zi,<br />âj â¤ p, yj&lt; zj.<br />(8)<br />Given evaluation results f(X1) = (f1(X1), ..., fp(X1)), ..., f(Xn) = (f1(Xn), ..., fp(Xn)), define<br />Hn= {y â B;âi â¤ n, f(Xi) âº y},<br />(9)<br />where B â Rpis a set of the form B = {y â Rp; y â¤ yupp} for some yuppâ Rp, which is introduced<br />to ensure that the volume of Hn is finite. Hn is the subset of B whose points are dominated by the<br />evaluations.<br />A natural idea, to extend the EI sampling criterion (5) to the multi-objective case, is to use the volume<br />of the non-dominated region as loss function:<br />Îµn(X,f) = |H \ Hn| ,<br />where H = {y â B;âx â X,f(x) âº y} and |Â·| denotes the usual (Lebesgue) volume in Rp. The im-<br />provement yielded by a new evaluation result f(Xn+1) = (f1(Xn+1),...,fp(Xn+1)) is then the increase<br />of the volume of the dominated region (see Figure 1):<br />In(Xn+1) = |H \ Hn| â |H \ Hn+1| = |Hn+1\ Hn| = |Hn+1| â |Hn|,<br />since Hn â Hn+1 â H. Given a vector-valued Gaussian random process model Î¾ = (Î¾1,...,Î¾p) of<br />f = (f1,...,fp), defined on a probability space (Î©,A,P0), a multi-objective EI criterion can then be<br />(10)</p>  <p>Page 6</p> <p>5<br />y1<br />y2<br />y3<br />f1<br />f2<br />B \ H3<br />Fig. 1: Example of an improvement of the dominated region. The regions dominated by y1 and y2 are represented in<br />shaded areas, with darker shades indicating overlapping regions. The hatched area corresponds to the improvement of the<br />dominated region resulting from the observation of y3.<br />derived as<br />Ïn(x) = En(In(x))<br />= En<br />??<br />B\Hn<br />1Î¾(x)âºydy<br />?<br />=<br />?<br />?<br />B\Hn<br />En<br />?1Î¾(x)âºy<br />Pn(Î¾(x) âº y) dy ,<br />?dy<br />=<br />B\Hn<br />(11)<br />where Pnstands for the probability P0conditioned on X1, Î¾(X1), ..., Xn, Î¾(Xn). The multi-objective<br />sampling criterion (11), also called Expected Hyper-Volume Improvement (EHVI), has been proposed by<br />Emmerich and coworkers (Emmerich, 2005; Emmerich et al., 2006; Emmerich and Klinkenberg, 2008).<br />Remark 1 A variety of alternative approaches have been proposed to extend the EI criterion to the<br />multi-objective case, which can be roughly classified into aggregation-based techniques (Knowles, 2006;<br />Knowles and Hughes, 2005; Zhang et al., 2010) and domination-based techniques (Jeong and Obayashi,<br />2005; Keane, 2006; Ponweiser et al., 2008; Bautista, 2009; Svenson and Santner, 2010; Wagner et al.,<br />2010). We consider these approaches are heuristic extensions of the EI criterion, in the sense that none<br />of them emerges from a proper Bayesian formulation (i.e., a myopic strategy associated to some well-<br />identified loss function). A detailed description of these approaches is out of the scope of this paper.<br />The reader is referred to Wagner et al. (2010), Couckuyt et al. (2014) and Horn et al. (2015) for some<br />comparisons and discussions. See also Picheny (2014b) and HernÃ¡ndez-Lobato et al. (2015a) for other<br />approaches not directly related to the concept of expected improvement.<br />Remark 2 The multi-objective sampling criterion (11) reduces to the usual EI criterion (5) in the single-<br />objective case (assuming that f(Xi) â¤ yuppfor at least one i â¤ n).</p>  <p>Page 7</p> <p>6<br />Under the assumption that the components Î¾i of Î¾ are mutually independent2, Pn(Î¾(x) âº y) can be<br />expressed in closed form: for all x â X and y â B \ Hn,<br />Pn(Î¾(x) âº y) =<br />p<br />?<br />i=1<br />Î¦<br />?<br />yiâ?Î¾i,n(x)<br />Ïi,n(x)<br />?<br />,<br />(12)<br />where?Î¾i,n(x) and Ï2<br />The integration of (12) over B \ Hn, in the expression (11) of the multi-objective EI criterion, is a non-<br />trivial problem. Several authors (Emmerich and Klinkenberg, 2008; Bader and Zitzler, 2011; Hupkens<br />et al., 2014; Couckuyt et al., 2014) have proposed decomposition methods to carry out this computation,<br />where the integration domain B\Hnis partitioned into hyper-rectangles, over which the integral can be<br />computed analytically. The computational complexity of these methods, however, increases exponentially<br />with the number of objectives3, which makes the approach impractical in problems with more than a few<br />objective functions. The method proposed in this work also encounters this type of integration problem,<br />but takes a different route to solve it (using SMC techniques; see Section 4). Our approach will make it<br />possible to deal with more objective functions.<br />i,n(x) denote respectively the kriging predictor and the kriging variance at x for<br />the ithcomponent of Î¾.<br />Remark 3 Exact and approximate implementations of the EHVI criterion are available, together with<br />other Gaussian-process-based criteria for bound-constrained multi-objective optimization, in the Mat-<br />lab/Octave toolbox STK (Bect et al., 2016) and in the R packages GPareto (Binois and Picheny, 2015)<br />and mlrMBO (Horn et al., 2015). Note that several approaches discussed in Remark 1 maintain an<br />affordable computational cost when the number of objectives grows, and therefore constitute possible<br />alternatives to the SMC technique proposed in this paper for many-objective box-constrained problems.<br />2.3 EI-based optimization with constraints<br />In this section, we discuss extensions of the expected improvement criterion for single- and multi-objective<br />constrained optimization.<br />Consider first the case of problems with a single objective and several constraints:<br />?minxâXf(x),<br />c(x) â¤ 0,<br />(13)<br />where c = (c1, ..., cq) is a vector of continuous constraints. The set C = {x â X; c(x) â¤ 0} is called the<br />feasible domain. If it is assumed that at least one evaluation has been made in C, it is natural to define a<br />notion of improvement with respect to the best objective value mn= min{f(x); x â {X1, ...,Xn} â© C}:<br />In(Xn+1) = mnâ mn+1<br />= 1c(Xn+1)â¤0Â·?mnâ f(Xn+1)?<br />=<br />0<br />+<br />?mnâ f(Xn+1) if Xn+1â C and f(Xn+1) &lt; mn,<br />otherwise.<br />(14)<br />2This is the most common modeling assumption in the Bayesian optimization literature, when several objective functions,<br />and possibly also several constraint functions, have to be dealt with. See the VIPER algorithm of Williams et al. (2010)<br />for an example of an algorithm based on correlated Gaussian processes.<br />3See, e.g., Beume (2009), Hupkens et al. (2014), Couckuyt et al. (2014) and references therein for decomposition<br />algorithms and complexity results.</p>  <p>Page 8</p> <p>7<br />In other words, a new observation makes an improvement if it is feasible and improves upon the best past<br />value (Schonlau et al., 1998). The corresponding expected improvement criterion follows from taking the<br />expectation:<br />Ïn(x) = En<br />?<br />1Î¾c(x)â¤0Â·?mnâ Î¾o(x)?<br />+<br />?<br />.<br />(15)<br />If f is modeled by a random process Î¾o and c is modeled by a vector-valued random process Î¾c =<br />(Î¾c,1, ..., Î¾c,q) independent of Î¾o, then the sampling criterion (15) simplifies to Schonlau et al.âs criterion:<br />Ïn(x) = Pn(Î¾c(x) â¤ 0) En<br />?(mnâ Î¾o(x))+<br />?.<br />(16)<br />In other words, the expected improvement is equal in this case to the product of the unconstrained ex-<br />pected improvement, with respect to mn, with the probability of feasibility. The sampling criterion (16)<br />is extensively discussed, and compared with other Gaussian-process-based constraint handling meth-<br />ods, in the PhD thesis of Sasena (2002). More generally, sampling criteria for constrained optimization<br />problems have been reviewed by Parr et al. (2012) and Gelbart (2015).<br />In the general case of constrained multi-objective problems, the aim is to build an approximation of Î<br />defined by (1). If it is assumed that an observation has been made in the feasible set C, a reasoning<br />similar to that used in the single-objective case can be made to formulate an extension of the EI (11):<br />Ïn(x) = En(|Hn+1| â |Hn|),<br />(17)<br />where<br />Hn= {y â B;âi â¤ n, Xiâ C and f(Xi) âº y}<br />(18)<br />is the subset of B, defined as in Section 2.2, whose points are dominated by feasible evaluations. When Î¾o<br />and Î¾care assumed independent, (17) boils down to the product of a modified EHVI criterion, where<br />only feasible points are considered4, and the probability of feasibility, as suggested by Emmerich et al.<br />(2006) and Shimoyama et al. (2013):<br />?<br />Ïn(x) = Pn(Î¾c(x) â¤ 0)<br />B\Hn<br />Pn(Î¾o(x) âº y) dy.<br />(19)<br />Observe that the sampling criterion (17) is the one-step look-ahead criterion associated to the loss<br />function Îµn(X,f) = â|Hn|, where Hnis defined by (18). This loss function remains constant as long<br />as no feasible point has been found and, therefore, is not an appropriate measure of loss for heavily<br />constrained problems where finding feasible points is sometimes the main difficulty5. From a practical<br />point of view, not all unfeasible points should be considered equivalent: a point that does not satisfy<br />a constraint by a small amount has probably more value than one that does not satisfy the constraint<br />by a large amount, and should therefore make the loss smaller. Section 3 will present a generalization<br />of the expected improvement for constrained problems, relying on a new loss function that encodes this<br />preference among unfeasible solutions.<br />Remark 4 Other Gaussian-process-based approaches that can be used to handle constraints include the<br />method by Gramacy et al. (to appear), based on the augmented Lagrangian approach of Conn et al.<br />(1991), and several recent methods (Picheny, 2014a; Gelbart, 2015; HernÃ¡ndez-Lobato et al., 2015b, to<br />appear) based on stepwise uncertainty reduction strategies (see, e.g., Villemonteix et al., 2009; Bect<br />et al., 2012; Chevalier et al., 2014, for more information on this topic).<br />4Note that this modified EHVI criterion remains well defined even when Hn= â, owing to the introduction of an upper<br />bound yuppin the definition of B. Its single-objective counterpart introduced earlier (see Equation (15)), however, was<br />only well defined under the assumption that at least one feasible point is known. Introducing an upper bound yuppis of<br />course also possible in the single-objective case.<br />5The same remark holds for the variant (see, e.g., Gelbart et al., 2014) which consists in using the probability of<br />feasibility as a sampling criterion when no feasible point is available. This is indeed equivalent to using the loss function<br />Îµn(X,f) = â1âiâ¤n,XiâCin the search for feasible points.</p>  <p>Page 9</p> <p>8<br />Remark 5 The term En<br />computation of the integral in (19) has been discussed in Section 2.2. If it is further assumed that the<br />components of Î¾care Gaussian and independent, then the probability of feasibility can be written as<br />?(mnâÎ¾o(x))+<br />?in (16) can be computed analytically as in Section 2.1, and the<br />?<br />Ïc,j,n(x)<br />Pn(Î¾c(x) â¤ 0) =<br />q?<br />j=1<br />Î¦<br />â<br />?Î¾c,j,n(x)<br />?<br />(20)<br />where?Î¾c,j,n(x) and Ï2<br />c,j,n(x) stand respectively for the kriging predictor and the kriging variance of Î¾c,j<br />at x.<br />3 An EI criterion for constrained multi-objective optimization<br />3.1 Extended domination rule<br />In a constrained multi-objective optimization setting, we propose to handle the constraints using an<br />extended Pareto domination rule that takes both objectives and constraints into account, in the spirit of<br />Fonseca and Fleming (1998), Ray et al.

In principle, sampling uniformly over Gncould be achieved using an accept-reject method (see,<br />e.g., Robert and Casella, 2013), by sampling uniformly over B and discarding points in Hn(Bader and<br />Zitzler, 2011). However, when the dimension of Y is high, Gnwill probably have a small volume with<br />respect to that of B. Then, the acceptance rate becomes small and the cost of generating a uniform<br />sample on Gn becomes prohibitive. (As an example, consider an optimization problem with q = 20<br />constraints. If Bc= [âv/2, +v/2]q, then the volume of the feasible region is 220â 106times smaller<br />than that of Bc.)<br />nâ 1Gn<br />In this work, we use a variant of the technique called subset simulation (Au and Beck, 2001; CÃ©rou et al.,<br />2012) to achieve uniform sampling over Gn.

When the objectives and con-<br />straints are independent, the decomposition introduced in Section 3.3 makes it possible to compute two<br />integrals over spaces of lower dimension (over Bc\ Hn,c and Bo\ Hn,o, respectively) instead of one<br />integral over Gn = B \ Hn. In fact, only one of the two integrals actually needs to be approximated<br />numerically: indeed, the term Ïfeasof the decomposition can be calculated in closed form prior to finding</p>  <p>Page 16</p> <p>15<br />feasible solutions, and the term Ïunfvanishes once a feasible observation has been made. We have taken<br />advantage of this observation for all the numerical results presented in Section 5.<br />4.2 Maximization of the sampling criterion<br />The optimization of the sampling criterion (22) is a difficult problem in itself because, even under the<br />unconstrained single-objective setting, the EI criterion is very often highly multi-modal. Our proposal is<br />to conduct a discrete search on a small set of good candidates provided at each iteration by a Sequential<br />Monte Carlo algorithm, in the spirit of Benassi et al. (2012), Li et al. (2012), Li (2012) and Benassi<br />(2013).<br />The key of such an algorithm is the choice of a suitable sequence?ÏX<br />sequence of densities are stabilityâÏX<br />the probability mass in regions corresponding to high values of the expected improvement. We propose,<br />following Benassi et al. (2012), to consider the sequence defined by<br />?ÏX<br />ÏX<br />In other words, we start from the uniform distribution on X and then we use the probability of improve-<br />ment x ?â Pn(Î¾(x) â Gn) as an un-normalized probability density function.<br />A procedure similar to that described in Algorithms 1 is used to generate particles distributed from<br />the target densities ÏX<br />particles<br />Xn= (xn,k,wn,k)m<br />such that the empirical distribution?<br />with respect to Section 4.1 is the introduction of weighted particles, which makes it possible to deal with<br />non-uniform target distributions. When a new sample is observed at step n, the weights of the particles<br />are updated to fit the new density ÏX<br />n<br />?<br />nâ¥0of probability density functions<br />on X, which will be the targets of the SMC algorithm. Desirable but antagonistic properties for this<br />n+1should not differ too much from ÏX<br />nâand concentration of<br />n(x) â 1<br />n(x) â Pn(Î¾(x) â Gn) for n = 1,2,...<br />if n = 0,<br />n.

Then, the corresponding particles are killed, and the particles with<br />non-degenerated weights are replicated to keep the size of the population constant. All particles are then<br />moved randomly using an MCMC transition kernel targeting ÏX<br />The corresponding procedure, which is very similar to that described in Algorithm 1, is summarized in<br />Algorithm 4.<br />n+1= (xn,k,w0<br />n+1,k)1â¤kâ¤m is then distributed from ÏX<br />n+1. Since the densities<br />n+1become different from the regions of high values for ÏX<br />n. Con-<br />n+1, in order to restore some diversity.<br />When the densities ÏX<br />non-degenerated weights is very small and that the empirical distribution?<br />of non uniform target densities, we use the Effective Sample Size (ESS) to detect degeneracy (see, e.g.,<br />Del Moral et al., 2006), instead of simply counting the surviving particles. When the ESS falls below<br />a prescribed fraction of the population size, we insert intermediate densities, in a similar way to what<br />was described in Section 4.1. The intermediate densities are of the form Ë Ïu(x) â Pn(Î¾(x) âËGu), with<br />Gn+1âËGuâ Gn. The corresponding modification of Algorithm 4 is straightforward.

We will denote them respectively by mX and mYin Section 5.<br />5 Experiments<br />5.1 Settings<br />The BMOO algorithm has been written in the Matlab/Octave programming language, using the Small<br />Toolbox for Kriging (STK) (Bect et al., 2016) for the Gaussian process modeling part. All simulation<br />results have been obtained using Matlab R2014b.<br />In all our experiments, the algorithm is initialized with a maximin Latin hypercube design consisting of<br />Ninit= 3d evaluations. This is an arbitrary rule of thumb. A dedicated discussion about the size of initial<br />designs can be found in Loeppky et al. (2009). The objective and constraint functions are modeled using<br />independent Gaussian processes, with a constant but unknown mean function, and a MatÃ©rn covariance<br />function with regularity parameter Î½ = 5/2 (these settings are described, for instance, in Bect et al.,<br />2012). The variance parameter Ï2and the range parameters Î¸i, 1 â¤ i â¤ d, of the covariance functions<br />are (re-)estimated at each iteration using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. Besides, we assume<br />that the observations are slightly noisy to improve the conditioning of the covariance matrices, as is<br />usually done in kriging implementations.<br />In Sections 5.3 and 5.4, the computation of the expected improvement is carried out using the SMC<br />method described in Section 4.1. Taking advantage of Remark 9, the integration is performed only on<br />the constraint space (prior to finding a feasible point) or the objective space (once a feasible point is<br />found). In the case of single-objective problems (Section 5.3), we perform exact calculation using (16)<br />once a feasible point has been observed. The parameter Î½ of Algorithm 3 is set to 0.2 and we take<br />m = mY= 1000 particles.

On Figure (c), thick dark curves correspond to the Pareto front.<br />For the optimization of the sampling criterion, we use the SMC method of Section 4.2, with m = mX=<br />1000 particles, residual resampling (Douc and CappÃ©, 2005), and an adaptive anisotropic Gaussian<br />random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to move the particles (Andrieu and Thoms, 2008; Roberts<br />and Rosenthal, 2009). When the probability of improvement cannot be written under closed-form, a<br />Monte Carlo approximation (see Remark 10) with N = 100 simulations is used.<br />5.2 Illustration on a constrained multi-objective problem<br />In this section, the proposed method is illustrated on a two-dimensional two-objective toy problem,<br />which allows for easy visualization. The optimization problem is as follows:<br />minimize<br />subject to<br />f1and f2,<br />c(x) â¤ 0 and x = (x1,x2) â [â5,10] Ã [0,15],<br />where<br />ï£±<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£´<br />ï£²<br />ï£³<br />f1: (x1,x2) ?â â(x1â 10)2â (x2â 15)2,<br />f2: (x1,x2) ?â â(x1+ 5)2â x2<br />?<br />2,<br />c : (x1,x2) ?â<br />x2â5.1<br />4Ï2x2<br />1+5<br />Ïx1â 6<br />?2<br />+ 10<br />?<br />1 â<br />1<br />8Ï<br />?<br />cos(x1) + 9.<br />The set of solutions to that problem is represented on Figure 5. The feasible subset consists of three<br />disconnected regions of relatively small size compared to that of the search space. The solution Pareto<br />front consists of three corresponding disconnected fronts in the space of objectives. (The visualization is<br />achieved by evaluating the objectives and constraints on a fine grid, which would not be affordable in<br />the case of truly expensive-to-evaluate functions.)<br />The behavior of BMOO is presented in Figure 6. The algorithm is initialized with 5d = 10 function<br />evaluations. Figure 6 shows that the algorithm correctly samples the three feasible regions, and achieves<br />good covering of the solution Pareto front after only a few iterations. Note that no feasible solution is<br />given at the beginning of the procedure and that the algorithm finds one after 10 iterations.</p>  <p>Page 19</p> <p>18<br />x1<br />x2<br />Input space (n = 10)<br />-5<br />0<br />05<br />10<br />5<br />10<br />15<br />f1<br />f2<br />Objective space (n = 10)<br />-300<br />-200<br />-1000<br />-400<br />-300<br />-200<br />-100<br />x1<br />x2<br />Input space (n = 20)<br />-5<br />0<br />05<br />10<br />5<br />10<br />15<br />f1<br />f2<br />Objective space (n = 20)<br />-300<br />-200-100<br />-250<br />-200<br />-150<br />-100<br />-50<br />x1<br />x2<br />Input space (n = 40)<br />-5<br />0<br />05<br />10<br />5<br />10<br />15<br />f1<br />f2<br />Objective space (n = 40)<br />-300<br />-200-100<br />-250<br />-200<br />-150<br />-100<br />-50<br />x1<br />x2<br />Input space (n = 60)<br />-5<br />0<br />05<br />10<br />5<br />10<br />15<br />f1<br />f2<br />Objective space (n = 60)<br />-300<br />-200-100<br />-250<br />-200<br />-150<br />-100<br />-50<br />Fig. 6: Convergence of the algorithm after n = 10,20,40 and 60 evaluations.

Table 1 summarizes the main features<br />of these problems. The input dimension d varies from 2 to 20, and the number q of constraints from 1<br />to 38. The problems may have linear or non-linear constraints but this information is not used by the<br />algorithms that we use in our comparisons (all functions are regarded as black boxes). Column Î(%)<br />gives the ratio in percents of the volume of feasible region C to the volume of the search space X. This<br />ratio has been estimated using Monte Carlo sampling and gives an indication on the difficulty of the<br />problem for finding a feasible point. Note that problems g1, g3mod, g6, g7, g10, g19 and in particular<br />problem g18 have very small feasible regions. The last two columns correspond respectively to the best<br />known feasible objective value and to target values for the optimization. The target values are the ones<br />used in the work of Regis (2014).<br />BMOO is compared to two classes of algorithms. The first class consists of four local optimization<br />algorithms: the COBYLA algorithm of Powell (1994), using the implementation proposed by Johnson<br />(2012), and three algorithms implemented in the Matlab function fmincon7, namely, an interior-point<br />algorithm, an active-set algorithm and an SQP algorithm. Local optimization methods are known to<br />perform well on a limited budget provided that good starting points are chosen. We think that they are<br />relevant competitors in our context. The second class of algorithms are those proposed by Regis (2014),<br />which are state-of-the-artâto the best of our knowledgeâalgorithms for constrained optimization under<br />a limited budget of evaluations.<br />Each algorithm is run 30 times on each problem of the benchmark. Note that we use a random starting<br />point uniformly distributed inside the search domain for local search algorithms, and a random initial<br />design for BMOO, as described in Section 5.1. For the local search algorithms the maximum number<br />of evaluations is set to two hundred times the dimension d of the problem. Concerning the algorithms<br />proposed by Regis (2014), we simply reproduce the results presented by the author; the reader is referred<br />to the original article for more details about the settings. Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. In<br />both tables, a solution is considered as feasible when there is no constraint violation larger than 10â5.<br />In Table 2, we measure the performance for finding feasible solutions. For local algorithms and Regisâ<br />algorithms, only the results of the best scoring algorithm are reported in the table. Full results are<br />presented in Appendix C. For local algorithms, the first column indicates the best scoring algorithm:<br />Cob for the COBYLA algorithm, IP for the interior-point algorithm, AS for the active-set algorithm<br />and SQP for the SQP algorithm. Similarly, for the algorithms proposed by Regis (2014), the first col-<br />7Optimization toolbox v7.1, MATLAB R2014b</p>  <p>Page 21</p> <p>20<br />umn indicates the best scoring algorithm: CG for COBRA-Global, CL for COBRA-Local and Ext for<br />Extended-ConstrLMSRBF. The second column gives the number of successful runsâa run being success-<br />ful when at least one feasible solution has been found. The third column gives the number of function<br />evaluations that were required to find the first feasible point, averaged over the successful runs. The<br />corresponding standard deviation is given in parentheses.<br />Table 3 presents convergence results. Again, for local algorithms and for those proposed by Regis (2014),<br />the first column indicates the best scoring algorithm. The next columns give successively the number of<br />successful runs (a run being considered successful when a feasible solution with objective value below<br />the target value of Table 1 has been found), the average numberâover successful runsâof evaluations<br />that were required to reach the target value, and the corresponding standard deviation (in parentheses).<br />The reader is referred to Appendix C for the full results.<br />BMOO achieves very good results on most test problems. It very often comes close to the best algorithm<br />in each of the two classes of competitors, and sometimes significantly outperforms both of themâsee,<br />in particular, the results for g1, g6, g7, g9, g16 and WB4 in Table 3. However, BMOO stalls on test<br />problems g3mod, g10, g18 and PVD4. We were able to identify the causes of theses problems and to<br />propose remedies, which are presented in the following paragraphs. It can also be observed that BMOO<br />is sometimes slower than the best algorithm of Regis (2014) to find a first feasible point. In almost all<br />cases (except for g10, g18 and PVD4, which are discussed separately below), this is easily explained by<br />the size of the initial design which is Ninit= 3d in our experiments (see Section 5.1). Further work on<br />this issue is required to make it possible to start BMOO with a much smaller set of evaluations.<br />Regarding g3mod, g10 and PVD4, the difficulty lies in the presence of functions, among the objective or<br />the constraints, which are not adequately modeled using a Gaussian process with a stationary covariance<br />function. However, as we can see in Table 4, the performances of BMOO are greatly improved in all<br />three cases if a transformation of the form f â fÎ»(for Î» &gt; 0) is applied to the functions that cause the<br />problem (see Appendix D for more details). Thus, we think that the theoretical foundations of BMOO<br />are not being questioned by these tests problems, but further work is needed on the Gaussian process<br />models for a proper treatment of these cases. In light of the results of our experiments, one promising<br />direction would be to consider models of the form Î¾Î», where Î¾ is a Gaussian process and Î» is a parameter<br />to be estimated from the evaluation results (see, e.g., Box and Cox, 1964; Snelson et al., 2004).<br />Regarding the g18 test problem, the difficulty stems from our choice of a sampling density derived<br />from the probability of improvement for optimizing the expected improvement. When the number of<br />constraints is high (q = 13 for the g18 test problem) and no feasible point has yet been found, the<br />expected number of particles in the feasible regions C is typically very small with this choice of density.<br />Consequently, there is a high probability that none of the particles produced by the SMC algorithm<br />are good candidates for the optimization of the expected improvement. To illustrate this phenomenon,<br />consider the following idealized setting. Suppose that q = d, X = [â1/2,1/2]qand cj: x = (x1,...,xq) ?â<br />|xj| âÎµ<br />of the subset of X where exactly k constraints are satisfied is<br />2, j = 1,...,q, for some Îµ â (0;1]. Thus, the feasible domain is C = [âÎµ/2,Îµ/2]qand the volume<br />Vkâ (q<br />k) Îµk(1 â Îµ)qâk.<br />Assume moreover that the Gaussian process models are almost perfect, i.e.,<br />Pn(Î¾c,j(x) â¤ 0) â<br />?<br />1,<br />0,<br />if cj(x) â¤ 0,<br />otherwise,<br />(33)<br />for j = 1,...,q. Further assume n = 1 with X1 =<br />by Î¾(x) for any x â X (except at the corners) so that the probability of improvement Pn(Î¾(x) â G1) is<br />close to one everywhere on X. As a consequence, the sampling density ÏX<br />expected improvement is (approximately) uniform on X and the expected number of particles satisfying<br />exactly k constraints is mVk. In particular, if q is large, the particles thus tend to concentrate in regions<br />?1<br />2,...,1<br />2<br />?<br />and observe that Î¾(X1) is dominated<br />1that we use to optimize the</p>  <p>Page 22</p> <p>21<br />Pbm<br />g1<br />g3mod<br />g5mod<br />g6<br />g7<br />g8<br />g9<br />g10<br />g13mod<br />g16<br />g18<br />g19<br />g24<br />SR7<br />WB4<br />PVD4<br />Local (best among 4)<br />IP30<br />IP30<br />AS 30<br />AS 30<br />SQP 30<br />IP 30<br />IP 30<br />SQP25<br />IP30<br />Cob27<br />SQP30<br />SQP30<br />IP30<br />SQP30<br />SQP30<br />SQP26<br />Regis (best among 3)<br />CG30<br />Ext 30<br />CL30<br />CL30<br />CG 30<br />CL 30<br />CG 30<br />CG30<br />Ext 30<br />Ext 30<br />CL30<br />CL30<br />CG30<br />CG30<br />CL30<br />CG30<br />BMOO<br />44.2 (1.9)<br />63.1 (0.6)<br />13.0 (1.2)<br />9.7 (0.7)<br />38.8 (3.3)<br />7.0 (0.2)<br />21.8 (5.1)<br />71.5 (28.1)<br />10.5 (5.6)<br />21.7 (7.3)<br />- (-)<br />46.4 (3.0)<br />2.6 (1.6)<br />22.0 (0.2)<br />19.1 (5.8)<br />15.7 (5.7)<br />128.4 (27.8)<br />342.3 (66.3)<br />35.0 (5.5)<br />29.7 (5.0)<br />107.6 (9.3)<br />12.1 (7.7)<br />170.9 (42.9)<br />144.6 (132.3)<br />21.4 (17.1)<br />31.5 (20.4)<br />101.9 (19.8)<br />19.7 (6.1)<br />4.0 (3.5)<br />27.1 (3.6)<br />76.6 (21.9)<br />7.6 (4.8)<br />15.0 (0)<br />31.2 (0.3)<br />6.4 (0.1)<br />10.9 (0.3)<br />47.5 (4.6)<br />6.5 (0.2)<br />21.5 (1.9)<br />22.8 (1.5)<br />8.6 (0.7)<br />19.6 (1.8)<br />108.6 (6.5)<br />16.5 (0.5)<br />1.3 (0.1)<br />9.5 (0.1)<br />37.4 (5.9)<br />7.9 (0.4)<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />0<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />30<br />Table 2: Number of evaluations to find a first feasible point.

The<br />most popular algorithms are probably NSGA2 (Deb et al., 2002) and SPEA2 (Zitzler et al., 2001). Such<br />algorithms, however, are not primarily designed to work on a limited budget of function<br />evaluations. Some methods that combine genetic/evolutionary approaches and surrogate modeling tech-<br />niques have been proposed in the literature (see, e.g., Emmerich et al., 2006; Jin, 2011, and references<br />therein), but a quantitative comparison with these methods would necessitate to develop proper imple-<br />mentations, which is out of the scope of this paper.

We compare our SMC approach (see Section 4.2) with the approach used by<br />Couckuyt et al. (2014), that we shall call MCSQP (for Monte-Carlo Sequential Quadratic Programming).<br />This approach consists in selecting the best point out of a population of candidates uniformly distributed<br />on the search space X, and then running an SQP algorithm starting from this point. In our experiments,<br />the number of candidates is chosen equal to the population size mX= 1000 of the SMC method.<br />Table 7 presents experimental results obtained with the extended EHVI criterion proposed in Section 3<br />as a sampling criterion. As a preliminary remark, observe that the finest target precision is systematically<br />reached by our SMC method in all but three test cases (OSY, TwoBarTruss and WeldedBeam). The<br />OSY case will be discussed below. On the TwoBarTruss and WeldedBeam problems, we found out that<br />the poor performances are due to Gaussian process modeling issues, similar to those encountered earlier<br />on the g3mod, g10 and PVD4 test problems (see Section 5.3). The results on these problems are thus<br />left out of the analyses in the following, but will motivate future work on the models, as concluded<br />in Section 5.3. Regarding the optimization of the criteria, the results show that our SMC approach<br />compares very favorably with MCSQP. More specifically, we note a drop of performance of the MCSQP<br />method compared with the SMC approach as we try to converge more finely toward the Pareto front<br />(see, in particular, column âTarget 99%â of Table 7, but this is also visible in the other columns as well<br />for most of the test cases). Because of its sequential nature, the SMC approach is able to track much<br />more efficiently the concentration of the sampling criterion in the search domain, and thus makes it<br />possible to reach higher accuracy.<br />Tables 8 and 9 provide additional results obtained when performing the same study with respectively the<br />EMMI and WCPI criteria9(see Svenson and Santner, 2010; Keane, 2006, respectively). These criteria<br />are not primarily designed to address constrained problems, but they can easily be extended to handle<br />constraints by calculating them using only feasible values of the objectives, and then multiplying them<br />by the probability of satisfying the constraints (as explained in Section 2.3). When no feasible solution<br />is available at the start of the optimization procedure, we use the probability of feasibility as a sampling<br />criterion, as advised by Gelbart et al. (2014). The conclusions drawn from Table 7 for the extended EHVI<br />criterion carry through to the results presented in Tables 8â9. It shows that the SMC algorithm proposed<br />in Section 4.2 can be viewed as a contribution of independent interest for optimizing improvement-based<br />sampling criteria.<br />Next we study the influence on the convergence of the algorithm of the number m = mYof particles used<br />in Algorithm 1 for approximating the expected improvement value. In Table 10 we compare the number<br />of evaluations required to dominate successively 90%, 95% and 99% of the volume V of Table 6 when<br />using different numbers of particles. As expected, the overall performances of the algorithm deteriorate<br />when the number mY of particles used to approximate the expected improvement decreases. However,<br />the algorithm maintains satisfactory convergence properties even with a small number of particles. For<br />reference, we have also included results obtained by choosing the evaluation point randomly in the set<br />of candidate points. Notice that these results are always much worse than those obtained using the<br />sampling criterion with mY= 200. This shows that not all candidate points are equally good, and thus<br />confirms that the sampling criterion, even with a rather small value of mY, is effectively discriminating<br />between good and bad candidate points.<br />We observe poor performances of the BMOO algorithm on the OSY test problem, regardless of the<br />number of particles that are used to estimate the expected improvement. Figure 8 reveals that this is<br />due to the choice of a uniform sampling density on Bo\Hnas the target density of the SMC algorithm<br />used for the approximate computation of the criterion. Indeed, most of the particles do not effectively<br />participate to the approximation of the integral, since they lie outside the set of feasible objective values<br />(see Figure 7(d)). Further work is required on this topic to propose a better sampling density, that would<br />9An implementation of the EMMI criterion is available in the STK.

The constraints are handled using an extended domination rule<br />and a new expected improvement formulation is proposed. In particular, the new formulation makes it<br />possible to deal with problems where no feasible solution is available from the start. Several criteria from<br />the literature are recovered as special cases.<br />The computation and optimization of the new expected improvement criterion are carried out using<br />sequential Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Indeed, the criterion takes the form of an integral over the<br />space of objectives and constraints, for which no closed-form expression is known.

The proposed sampling techniques borrow ideas from<br />the literature of structural reliability for estimating the probability of rare events, and can be viewed as<br />a contribution in itself.<br />We show that the resulting algorithm, which we call BMOO, achieves good results on a set of single-<br />objective constrained test problems, with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, BMOO<br />is able to effectively find feasible solutions, even when the feasible region is very small compared to<br />the size of the search space and when the number of constraints is high. In the case of multi-objective<br />optimization with non-linear constraints, we show that BMOO is able to yield good approximations of<br />the Pareto front on small budgets of evaluations.<br />Several questions are left open for future work. First, our numerical studies reveal that the choice<br />of sampling densities in the input domain (as demonstrated by unsatisfactory results on the g18 test<br />problem) and in the output domain (as shown on the OSY case) could be improved. Suggestions for<br />improvement are proposed in the article and will be the object of future investigations. Second, an in-<br />depth study of the quality of the approximation provided by our SMC method, and a comparison with<br />exact methods, is needed before recommandations can be made on when to switch between exact and<br />approximate calculation of the expected improvement, and how to select the sample sizeâpossibly in<br />an adaptive mannerâused for the SMC approximation. Last, the choice of the random processes used<br />for modeling objective and constraint functions deserves more attention. Stationary Gaussian process</p>  <p>Page 29</p> <p>28<br />models have been found to lack flexibility on some single- and multi-objective cases (g3mod, g10, PVD4,<br />TwoBarTruss and WeldedBeam).

SPEA2: Improving Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm,<br />2001.<br />arXiv preprint<br />A On the bounded hyper-rectangles Boand Bc<br />We have assumed in Section 3 that Bo and Bc are bounded hyper-rectangles; that is, sets of the form<br />Bo=?y â Yo; ylow<br />o<br />â¤ y â¤ yupp<br />â¤ y â¤ yupp<br />o<br />?,<br />Bc=?y â Yc; ylow<br />â Yc, with the additional assumption that ylow<br />cc<br />?,<br />for some ylow<br />Remember that upper bounds only where required in the unconstrained case discussed in Section 2.2.

It is clear from the right-hand side of (34) that both Bo and Bc have to be bounded if we want<br />|H1| &lt; +â for any Î³ = (Î³1,,..., Î³q) â {0,1}q. Note, however, that only the volume of Bo actually matters in this<br />expression, not the actual values of ylow<br />o<br />o<br />. Equation (34) also reveals that the improvement is a discontinuous<br />function of the observations: indeed, the jthterm in the product jumps from yupp<br />goes from 0+to 0.

As said in Section 3.3, these hyper-rectangles are defined using estimates of the range of the objective<br />and constraint functions, respectively. To this end, we will use the available evaluations results, together with posterior<br />quantiles provided by our Gaussian process models on the set of candidate points Xn (defined in Section 4.2).<br />More precisely, assume that n evaluation results Î¾(Xi), 1 â¤ i â¤ n, are available. Then, we define the corners of Bo by<br />ï£±<br />ï£³<br />for 1 â¤ i â¤ p, and the corners of Bc by<br />ï£±<br />ï£³<br />for 1 â¤ j â¤ q, where Î»o and Î»c are positive numbers.<br />ï£²<br />ylow<br />o,i,n= min<br />yupp<br />o,i,n= max<br />?<br />miniâ¤nÎ¾o,i(Xi), minxâXn?Î¾o, i, n(x) â Î»oÏo, i, n(x)<br />?<br />,<br />?<br />maxiâ¤nÎ¾o,i(Xi), maxxâXn?Î¾o, i, n(x) + Î»oÏo, i, n(x)<br />?<br />,<br />(36)<br />ï£²<br />ylow<br />c,j,n= min<br />yupp<br />c,j,n= max<br />?<br />0, miniâ¤nÎ¾c,j(Xi), minxâXn?Î¾c, j, n(x) â Î»cÏc, j, n(x)<br />?<br />,<br />?<br />0, maxiâ¤nÎ¾c,j(Xi), maxxâXn?Î¾c, j, n(x) + Î»cÏc, j, n(x)<br />?<br />,<br />(37)<br />C Mono-objective benchmark result tables<br />In Section 5.3, only the best results for both the âLocalâ and the âRegisâ groups of algorithms were shown. In this Appendix,<br />we present the full results. Tables 11 and 12, and Tables 13 and 14 present respectively the results obtained with the local<br />optimization algorithms and the results obtained by Regis (2014) on the single-objective benchmark test problems (see<br />Table 1). Table 11 and Table 12 show the performances for finding feasible solutions and for reaching the targets specified<br />in Table 1 for the COBYLA, Active-Set, Interior-Point and SQP algorithms. Similarly, Table 13 and Table 14 show<br />the performances for finding feasible solutions and for reaching the targets for the COBRA-Local, COBRA-Global and<br />Extended-ConstrLMSRBF algorithms of Regis (2014).<br />D Modified g3mod, g10 and PVD4 test problems<br />We detail here the modified formulations of the g3mod, g10 and PVD4 problems that were used in Section 5.3 to overcome<br />the modeling problems with BMOO.

article addresses the problem of derivative-free (single- or multi-objective) optimization subject to multiple inequality constraints. Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in the Bayesian and the multiobjective optimization literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle the constraints and a corresponding Bayesian expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion extends existing Bayesian sampling criteria to the multi-objective constrained case, and makes it possible to start the algorithm without an initial feasible point. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential Monte Carlo techniques.

Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to\nbe smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that\ncan be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization\nproblems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in both the Bayesian and\nthe multi-objective optimization literatures. More specifically, we construct a loss function based on an\nextended domination rule to handle the objectives and the constraints simultaneously. Then, we derive\na corresponding (Bayesian) expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion. This new sampling\ncriterion makes it possible to build an optimization algorithm that can start without any feasible point.\nThe new sampling criterion reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria\u2014the classical Expected Im-\nprovement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained\/multi-objective extensions\u2014as soon as at least one\nfeasible point is available. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequen-\ntial Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset simulation method, which\nis well known in the field of structural reliability, is used to estimate the expected hyper-volume im-\nprovement criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization), is\ncompared to state-of-the-art algorithms for single-objective and multi-objective constrained optimization\nproblems.\nKeywords Bayesian optimization \u00b7 Expected improvement \u00b7 Kriging \u00b7 Gaussian process \u00b7 Multi-\nObjective \u00b7 Sequential Monte Carlo \u00b7 Subset simulation\n1 Introduction\nThis article addresses the problem of derivative-free multi-objective optimization of real-valued functions\nsubject to multiple inequality constraints.

The search domain X is assumed to be compact\u2014typically, X is a hyper-rectangle defined\nby bound constraints. Moreover, the objective and constraint functions are regarded as black boxes\nand, in particular, we assume that no gradient information is available. Finally, the objective and the\nconstraint functions are assumed to be expensive to evaluate, which arises for instance when the values\nf(x) and c(x), for a given x \u2208 X, correspond to the outputs of a computationally expensive computer\nprogram. In this setting, the emphasis is on building optimization algorithms that perform well under a\nvery limited budget of evaluations (e.g., a few hundred evaluations).\nWe adopt a Bayesian approach to this optimization problem. The essence of Bayesian optimization is to\nchoose a prior model for the expensive-to-evaluate function(s) involved in the optimization problem\u2014\nusually a Gaussian process model (Santner et al., 2003; Williams and Rasmussen, 2006) for tractability\u2014\nand then to select the evaluation points sequentially in order to obtain a small average error between the\napproximation obtained by the optimization algorithm and the optimal solution, under the selected prior.\nSee, e.g., Kushner (1964); Mockus (1975); Mockus et al. (1978); Archetti and Betr\u00f2 (1979) and Mockus\n(1989) for some of the earliest references in the field. Bayesian optimization research was first focused\non the case of single-objective bound-constrained optimization: the Expected Improvement (EI) crite-\nrion (Mockus et al., 1978; Jones et al., 1998) has emerged in this case as one of the most popular criteria\nfor selecting evaluation points. Later, the EI criterion has been extended to handle constraints (Schonlau\net al., 1998; Sasena et al., 2002; Gramacy and Lee, 2011; Gelbart et al., 2014; Gramacy et al., to appear)\nand to address bound-constrained multi-objective problems (Emmerich et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2006;\nWagner et al., 2010; Svenson and Santner, 2010).\nThe contribution of this article is twofold. The first part of the contribution is the proposition of a\nnew sampling criterion that handles multiple objectives and non-linear constraints simultaneously. This\ncriterion corresponds to a one-step look-ahead Bayesian strategy, using the dominated hyper-volume as a\nutility function (following in this respect Emmerich et al., 2006). More specifically, the dominated hyper-\nvolume is defined using an extended domination rule, which handles both the objectives and constraints\njointly (in the spirit of Fonseca and Fleming, 1998; Ray et al., 2001; Oyama et al., 2007). Our new criterion\nis naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and several criteria from\nthe literature\u2014the EI criterion and some of its constrained\/multi-objective extensions\u2014are recovered\nas special cases when at least one feasible point is known. The second part of the contribution lies in the\nnumerical methods employed to compute and optimize the sampling criterion. Indeed, this criterion takes\nthe form of an integral over the space of constraints and objectives, for which no analytical expression is\navailable in the general case. Besides, it must be optimized at each iteration of the algorithm to determine\nthe next evaluation point. In order to compute the integral, we use an algorithm similar to the subset\nsimulation method (Au and Beck, 2001; C\u00e9rou et al., 2012), which is a well known Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) technique (see Del Moral et al., 2006; Liu, 2008, and references therein) from the field of\nstructural reliability and rare event estimation. For the optimization of the criterion, we resort to an SMC\nmethod as well, following earlier work by Benassi et al. (2012) for single-objective bound-constrained\nproblems. The resulting algorithm is called BMOO (for Bayesian multi-objective optimization).\nThe structure of the article is as follows. In Section 2, we recall the framework of Bayesian optimization\nbased on the expected improvement sampling criterion, starting with the unconstrained single-objective\nsetting. Section 3 presents our new sampling criterion for constrained multi-objective optimization. The\ncalculation and the optimization of the criterion are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents experimen-\ntal results. An illustration on a two-dimensional toy problem is proposed for visualization purpose. Then,\nthe performances of the method are compared to those of reference methods on both single-objective and\nmulti-objective constrained optimization problems from the literature. Finally, future work is discussed\nin Section 6."},{"page":4,"text":"3\n2 Background literature\n2.1 Expected Improvement\nConsider the single-objective unconstrained optimization problem\nx?= argminx\u2208Xf(x),\nwhere f is a continuous real-valued function defined over X \u2282 Rd. Our objective is to find an approxima-\ntion of x?using a sequence of evaluation points X1, X2, ... \u2208 X. Because the choice of a new evaluation\npoint Xn+1at iteration n depends on the evaluation results of f at X1, ..., Xn, the construction of an\noptimization strategy X : f ?\u2192 (X1, X2, X3...) is a sequential decision problem.\nThe Bayesian approach to this decision problem originates from the early work of Kushner (1964)\nand Mockus et al. (1978). Assume that a loss function \u03b5n(X,f) has been chosen to measure the perfor-\nmance of the strategy X on f after n evaluations, for instance the classical loss function\n\u03b5n(X,f) = mn\u2212 m,\n(2)\nwith mn= f(X1) \u2227 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2227 f(Xn) and m = minx\u2208Xf(x). Then, a good strategy in the Bayesian sense\nis a strategy that achieves, on average, a small value of \u03b5n(X,f) when n increases, where the average\nis taken with respect to a stochastic process model \u03be (defined on a probability space (\u03a9,A,P0), with\nparameter in X) for the function f. In other words, the Bayesian approach assumes that f = \u03be(\u03c9,\u00b7) for\nsome \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. The probability distribution of \u03be represents prior knowledge about the function f\u2014before\nactual evaluations are performed. The reader is referred to Vazquez and Bect (2014) for a discussion of\nother possible loss functions in the context of Bayesian optimization.\nObserving that the Bayes-optimal strategy for a budget of N evaluations is intractable for N greater\nthan a few units, Mockus et al. (1978) proposed to use a one-step look-ahead strategy (also known as a\nmyopic strategy). Given n < N evaluation results, the next evaluation point Xn+1is chosen in order to\nminimize the conditional expectation of the future loss \u03b5n+1(X,\u03be) given available evaluation results:\n?\u03b5n+1(X,\u03be) | Xn+1= x?,\nwhere Enstands for the conditional expectation with respect to X1, \u03be(X1), ..., Xn, \u03be(Xn). Most of the\nwork produced in the field of Bayesian optimization since then has been focusing, as the present paper\nwill, on one-step look-ahead (or similar) strategies1; the reader is referred to Ginsbouger and Le Riche\n(2009) and Benassi (2013) for discussions about two-step look-ahead strategies.\nXn+1= argminx\u2208XEn\n(3)\nWhen (2) is used as a loss function, the right-hand side of (3) can be rewritten as\n?\u03b5n+1(X,\u03be) | Xn+1= x?= argminEn\nargminEn\n?mn+1\n??Xn+1= x?\n= argmaxEn\n?(mn\u2212 \u03be(x))+\n?,\n(4)\nwith z+= max(z, 0).

Recently, sequential Monte Carlo techniques (see Del Moral\net al., 2006; Liu, 2008, and references therein) have been shown to be a valuable tool for this task (Benassi\net al., 2012). A review of other approaches is provided in the PhD thesis of Benassi (2013, Section 4.2).\n2.2 EI-based multi-objective optimization without constraints\nWe now turn to the case of unconstrained multi-objective optimization. Under this framework, we con-\nsider a set of objective functions fj : X \u2192 R, j = 1, ..., p, to be minimized, and the objective is to\nbuild an approximation of the Pareto front and of the set of corresponding solutions\n\u0393 = {x \u2208 X : ?x?\u2208 X such that f(x?) \u227a f(x)},\n(7)\nwhere \u227a stands for the Pareto domination rule defined by\ny = (y1, ..., yp) \u227a z = (z1, ..., zp) \u21d0\u21d2\n?\u2200i \u2264 p, yi\u2264 zi,\n\u2203j \u2264 p, yj< zj.\n(8)\nGiven evaluation results f(X1) = (f1(X1), ..., fp(X1)), ..., f(Xn) = (f1(Xn), ..., fp(Xn)), define\nHn= {y \u2208 B;\u2203i \u2264 n, f(Xi) \u227a y},\n(9)\nwhere B \u2282 Rpis a set of the form B = {y \u2208 Rp; y \u2264 yupp} for some yupp\u2208 Rp, which is introduced\nto ensure that the volume of Hn is finite. Hn is the subset of B whose points are dominated by the\nevaluations.\nA natural idea, to extend the EI sampling criterion (5) to the multi-objective case, is to use the volume\nof the non-dominated region as loss function:\n\u03b5n(X,f) = |H \\ Hn| ,\nwhere H = {y \u2208 B;\u2203x \u2208 X,f(x) \u227a y} and |\u00b7| denotes the usual (Lebesgue) volume in Rp. The im-\nprovement yielded by a new evaluation result f(Xn+1) = (f1(Xn+1),...,fp(Xn+1)) is then the increase\nof the volume of the dominated region (see Figure 1):\nIn(Xn+1) = |H \\ Hn| \u2212 |H \\ Hn+1| = |Hn+1\\ Hn| = |Hn+1| \u2212 |Hn|,\nsince Hn \u2282 Hn+1 \u2282 H.

We consider these approaches are heuristic extensions of the EI criterion, in the sense that none\nof them emerges from a proper Bayesian formulation (i.e., a myopic strategy associated to some well-\nidentified loss function). A detailed description of these approaches is out of the scope of this paper.\nThe reader is referred to Wagner et al. (2010), Couckuyt et al. (2014) and Horn et al.

Note that several approaches discussed in Remark 1 maintain an\naffordable computational cost when the number of objectives grows, and therefore constitute possible\nalternatives to the SMC technique proposed in this paper for many-objective box-constrained problems.\n2.3 EI-based optimization with constraints\nIn this section, we discuss extensions of the expected improvement criterion for single- and multi-objective\nconstrained optimization.\nConsider first the case of problems with a single objective and several constraints:\n?minx\u2208Xf(x),\nc(x) \u2264 0,\n(13)\nwhere c = (c1, ..., cq) is a vector of continuous constraints. The set C = {x \u2208 X; c(x) \u2264 0} is called the\nfeasible domain. If it is assumed that at least one evaluation has been made in C, it is natural to define a\nnotion of improvement with respect to the best objective value mn= min{f(x); x \u2208 {X1, ...,Xn} \u2229 C}:\nIn(Xn+1) = mn\u2212 mn+1\n= 1c(Xn+1)\u22640\u00b7?mn\u2212 f(Xn+1)?\n=\n0\n+\n?mn\u2212 f(Xn+1) if Xn+1\u2208 C and f(Xn+1) < mn,\notherwise.\n(14)\n2This is the most common modeling assumption in the Bayesian optimization literature, when several objective functions,\nand possibly also several constraint functions, have to be dealt with. See the VIPER algorithm of Williams et al. (2010)\nfor an example of an algorithm based on correlated Gaussian processes.\n3See, e.g., Beume (2009), Hupkens et al. (2014), Couckuyt et al.

More generally, sampling criteria for constrained optimization\nproblems have been reviewed by Parr et al.

When \u03beo\nand \u03becare assumed independent, (17) boils down to the product of a modified EHVI criterion, where\nonly feasible points are considered4, and the probability of feasibility, as suggested by Emmerich et al.\n(2006) and Shimoyama et al.

This loss function remains constant as long\nas no feasible point has been found and, therefore, is not an appropriate measure of loss for heavily\nconstrained problems where finding feasible points is sometimes the main difficulty5. From a practical\npoint of view, not all unfeasible points should be considered equivalent: a point that does not satisfy\na constraint by a small amount has probably more value than one that does not satisfy the constraint\nby a large amount, and should therefore make the loss smaller. Section 3 will present a generalization\nof the expected improvement for constrained problems, relying on a new loss function that encodes this\npreference among unfeasible solutions.\nRemark 4 Other Gaussian-process-based approaches that can be used to handle constraints include the\nmethod by Gramacy et al. (to appear), based on the augmented Lagrangian approach of Conn et al.\n(1991), and several recent methods (Picheny, 2014a; Gelbart, 2015; Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato et al., 2015b, to\nappear) based on stepwise uncertainty reduction strategies (see, e.g., Villemonteix et al., 2009; Bect\net al., 2012; Chevalier et al., 2014, for more information on this topic).\n4Note that this modified EHVI criterion remains well defined even when Hn= \u2205, owing to the introduction of an upper\nbound yuppin the definition of B. Its single-objective counterpart introduced earlier (see Equation (15)), however, was\nonly well defined under the assumption that at least one feasible point is known. Introducing an upper bound yuppis of\ncourse also possible in the single-objective case.\n5The same remark holds for the variant (see, e.g., Gelbart et al., 2014) which consists in using the probability of\nfeasibility as a sampling criterion when no feasible point is available.

In principle, sampling uniformly over Gncould be achieved using an accept-reject method (see,\ne.g., Robert and Casella, 2013), by sampling uniformly over B and discarding points in Hn(Bader and\nZitzler, 2011). However, when the dimension of Y is high, Gnwill probably have a small volume with\nrespect to that of B. Then, the acceptance rate becomes small and the cost of generating a uniform\nsample on Gn becomes prohibitive. (As an example, consider an optimization problem with q = 20\nconstraints. If Bc= [\u2212v\/2, +v\/2]q, then the volume of the feasible region is 220\u2248 106times smaller\nthan that of Bc.)\nn\u221d 1Gn\nIn this work, we use a variant of the technique called subset simulation (Au and Beck, 2001; C\u00e9rou et al.,\n2012) to achieve uniform sampling over Gn.

All simulation\nresults have been obtained using Matlab R2014b.\nIn all our experiments, the algorithm is initialized with a maximin Latin hypercube design consisting of\nNinit= 3d evaluations. This is an arbitrary rule of thumb. A dedicated discussion about the size of initial\ndesigns can be found in Loeppky et al. (2009). The objective and constraint functions are modeled using\nindependent Gaussian processes, with a constant but unknown mean function, and a Mat\u00e9rn covariance\nfunction with regularity parameter \u03bd = 5\/2 (these settings are described, for instance, in Bect et al.,\n2012). The variance parameter \u03c32and the range parameters \u03b8i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d, of the covariance functions\nare (re-)estimated at each iteration using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. Besides, we assume\nthat the observations are slightly noisy to improve the conditioning of the covariance matrices, as is\nusually done in kriging implementations.\nIn Sections 5.3 and 5.4, the computation of the expected improvement is carried out using the SMC\nmethod described in Section 4.1. Taking advantage of Remark 9, the integration is performed only on\nthe constraint space (prior to finding a feasible point) or the objective space (once a feasible point is\nfound).

On Figure (c), thick dark curves correspond to the Pareto front.\nFor the optimization of the sampling criterion, we use the SMC method of Section 4.2, with m = mX=\n1000 particles, residual resampling (Douc and Capp\u00e9, 2005), and an adaptive anisotropic Gaussian\nrandom walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to move the particles (Andrieu and Thoms, 2008; Roberts\nand Rosenthal, 2009). When the probability of improvement cannot be written under closed-form, a\nMonte Carlo approximation (see Remark 10) with N = 100 simulations is used.\n5.2 Illustration on a constrained multi-objective problem\nIn this section, the proposed method is illustrated on a two-dimensional two-objective toy problem,\nwhich allows for easy visualization. The optimization problem is as follows:\nminimize\nsubject to\nf1and f2,\nc(x) \u2264 0 and x = (x1,x2) \u2208 [\u22125,10] \u00d7 [0,15],\nwhere\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nf1: (x1,x2) ?\u2192 \u2212(x1\u2212 10)2\u2212 (x2\u2212 15)2,\nf2: (x1,x2) ?\u2192 \u2212(x1+ 5)2\u2212 x2\n?\n2,\nc : (x1,x2) ?\u2192\nx2\u22125.1\n4\u03c02x2\n1+5\n\u03c0x1\u2212 6\n?2\n+ 10\n?\n1 \u2212\n1\n8\u03c0\n?\ncos(x1) + 9.\nThe set of solutions to that problem is represented on Figure 5. The feasible subset consists of three\ndisconnected regions of relatively small size compared to that of the search space. The solution Pareto\nfront consists of three corresponding disconnected fronts in the space of objectives. (The visualization is\nachieved by evaluating the objectives and constraints on a fine grid, which would not be affordable in\nthe case of truly expensive-to-evaluate functions.)\nThe behavior of BMOO is presented in Figure 6. The algorithm is initialized with 5d = 10 function\nevaluations. Figure 6 shows that the algorithm correctly samples the three feasible regions, and achieves\ngood covering of the solution Pareto front after only a few iterations. Note that no feasible solution is\ngiven at the beginning of the procedure and that the algorithm finds one after 10 iterations."},{"page":19,"text":"18\nx1\nx2\nInput space (n = 10)\n-5\n0\n05\n10\n5\n10\n15\nf1\nf2\nObjective space (n = 10)\n-300\n-200\n-1000\n-400\n-300\n-200\n-100\nx1\nx2\nInput space (n = 20)\n-5\n0\n05\n10\n5\n10\n15\nf1\nf2\nObjective space (n = 20)\n-300\n-200-100\n-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\nx1\nx2\nInput space (n = 40)\n-5\n0\n05\n10\n5\n10\n15\nf1\nf2\nObjective space (n = 40)\n-300\n-200-100\n-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\nx1\nx2\nInput space (n = 60)\n-5\n0\n05\n10\n5\n10\n15\nf1\nf2\nObjective space (n = 60)\n-300\n-200-100\n-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\nFig. 6: Convergence of the algorithm after n = 10,20,40 and 60 evaluations.

Table 1 summarizes the main features\nof these problems. The input dimension d varies from 2 to 20, and the number q of constraints from 1\nto 38. The problems may have linear or non-linear constraints but this information is not used by the\nalgorithms that we use in our comparisons (all functions are regarded as black boxes). Column \u0393(%)\ngives the ratio in percents of the volume of feasible region C to the volume of the search space X. This\nratio has been estimated using Monte Carlo sampling and gives an indication on the difficulty of the\nproblem for finding a feasible point. Note that problems g1, g3mod, g6, g7, g10, g19 and in particular\nproblem g18 have very small feasible regions. The last two columns correspond respectively to the best\nknown feasible objective value and to target values for the optimization. The target values are the ones\nused in the work of Regis (2014).\nBMOO is compared to two classes of algorithms. The first class consists of four local optimization\nalgorithms: the COBYLA algorithm of Powell (1994), using the implementation proposed by Johnson\n(2012), and three algorithms implemented in the Matlab function fmincon7, namely, an interior-point\nalgorithm, an active-set algorithm and an SQP algorithm. Local optimization methods are known to\nperform well on a limited budget provided that good starting points are chosen. We think that they are\nrelevant competitors in our context. The second class of algorithms are those proposed by Regis (2014),\nwhich are state-of-the-art\u2014to the best of our knowledge\u2014algorithms for constrained optimization under\na limited budget of evaluations.\nEach algorithm is run 30 times on each problem of the benchmark. Note that we use a random starting\npoint uniformly distributed inside the search domain for local search algorithms, and a random initial\ndesign for BMOO, as described in Section 5.1. For the local search algorithms the maximum number\nof evaluations is set to two hundred times the dimension d of the problem. Concerning the algorithms\nproposed by Regis (2014), we simply reproduce the results presented by the author; the reader is referred\nto the original article for more details about the settings. Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. In\nboth tables, a solution is considered as feasible when there is no constraint violation larger than 10\u22125.\nIn Table 2, we measure the performance for finding feasible solutions. For local algorithms and Regis\u2019\nalgorithms, only the results of the best scoring algorithm are reported in the table. Full results are\npresented in Appendix C. For local algorithms, the first column indicates the best scoring algorithm:\nCob for the COBYLA algorithm, IP for the interior-point algorithm, AS for the active-set algorithm\nand SQP for the SQP algorithm. Similarly, for the algorithms proposed by Regis (2014), the first col-\n7Optimization toolbox v7.1, MATLAB R2014b"},{"page":21,"text":"20\numn indicates the best scoring algorithm: CG for COBRA-Global, CL for COBRA-Local and Ext for\nExtended-ConstrLMSRBF. The second column gives the number of successful runs\u2014a run being success-\nful when at least one feasible solution has been found. The third column gives the number of function\nevaluations that were required to find the first feasible point, averaged over the successful runs. The\ncorresponding standard deviation is given in parentheses.\nTable 3 presents convergence results. Again, for local algorithms and for those proposed by Regis (2014),\nthe first column indicates the best scoring algorithm. The next columns give successively the number of\nsuccessful runs (a run being considered successful when a feasible solution with objective value below\nthe target value of Table 1 has been found), the average number\u2014over successful runs\u2014of evaluations\nthat were required to reach the target value, and the corresponding standard deviation (in parentheses).\nThe reader is referred to Appendix C for the full results.\nBMOO achieves very good results on most test problems. It very often comes close to the best algorithm\nin each of the two classes of competitors, and sometimes significantly outperforms both of them\u2014see,\nin particular, the results for g1, g6, g7, g9, g16 and WB4 in Table 3. However, BMOO stalls on test\nproblems g3mod, g10, g18 and PVD4. We were able to identify the causes of theses problems and to\npropose remedies, which are presented in the following paragraphs. It can also be observed that BMOO\nis sometimes slower than the best algorithm of Regis (2014) to find a first feasible point. In almost all\ncases (except for g10, g18 and PVD4, which are discussed separately below), this is easily explained by\nthe size of the initial design which is Ninit= 3d in our experiments (see Section 5.1). Further work on\nthis issue is required to make it possible to start BMOO with a much smaller set of evaluations.\nRegarding g3mod, g10 and PVD4, the difficulty lies in the presence of functions, among the objective or\nthe constraints, which are not adequately modeled using a Gaussian process with a stationary covariance\nfunction. However, as we can see in Table 4, the performances of BMOO are greatly improved in all\nthree cases if a transformation of the form f \u2192 f\u03bb(for \u03bb > 0) is applied to the functions that cause the\nproblem (see Appendix D for more details). Thus, we think that the theoretical foundations of BMOO\nare not being questioned by these tests problems, but further work is needed on the Gaussian process\nmodels for a proper treatment of these cases. In light of the results of our experiments, one promising\ndirection would be to consider models of the form \u03be\u03bb, where \u03be is a Gaussian process and \u03bb is a parameter\nto be estimated from the evaluation results (see, e.g., Box and Cox, 1964; Snelson et al., 2004).\nRegarding the g18 test problem, the difficulty stems from our choice of a sampling density derived\nfrom the probability of improvement for optimizing the expected improvement. When the number of\nconstraints is high (q = 13 for the g18 test problem) and no feasible point has yet been found, the\nexpected number of particles in the feasible regions C is typically very small with this choice of density.\nConsequently, there is a high probability that none of the particles produced by the SMC algorithm\nare good candidates for the optimization of the expected improvement. To illustrate this phenomenon,\nconsider the following idealized setting. Suppose that q = d, X = [\u22121\/2,1\/2]qand cj: x = (x1,...,xq) ?\u2192\n|xj| \u2212\u03b5\nof the subset of X where exactly k constraints are satisfied is\n2, j = 1,...,q, for some \u03b5 \u2208 (0;1]. Thus, the feasible domain is C = [\u2212\u03b5\/2,\u03b5\/2]qand the volume\nVk\u2248 (q\nk) \u03b5k(1 \u2212 \u03b5)q\u2212k.\nAssume moreover that the Gaussian process models are almost perfect, i.e.,\nPn(\u03bec,j(x) \u2264 0) \u2248\n?\n1,\n0,\nif cj(x) \u2264 0,\notherwise,\n(33)\nfor j = 1,...,q. Further assume n = 1 with X1 =\nby \u03be(x) for any x \u2208 X (except at the corners) so that the probability of improvement Pn(\u03be(x) \u2208 G1) is\nclose to one everywhere on X. As a consequence, the sampling density \u03c0X\nexpected improvement is (approximately) uniform on X and the expected number of particles satisfying\nexactly k constraints is mVk. In particular, if q is large, the particles thus tend to concentrate in regions\n?1\n2,...,1\n2\n?\nand observe that \u03be(X1) is dominated\n1that we use to optimize the"},{"page":22,"text":"21\nPbm\ng1\ng3mod\ng5mod\ng6\ng7\ng8\ng9\ng10\ng13mod\ng16\ng18\ng19\ng24\nSR7\nWB4\nPVD4\nLocal (best among 4)\nIP30\nIP30\nAS 30\nAS 30\nSQP 30\nIP 30\nIP 30\nSQP25\nIP30\nCob27\nSQP30\nSQP30\nIP30\nSQP30\nSQP30\nSQP26\nRegis (best among 3)\nCG30\nExt 30\nCL30\nCL30\nCG 30\nCL 30\nCG 30\nCG30\nExt 30\nExt 30\nCL30\nCL30\nCG30\nCG30\nCL30\nCG30\nBMOO\n44.2 (1.9)\n63.1 (0.6)\n13.0 (1.2)\n9.7 (0.7)\n38.8 (3.3)\n7.0 (0.2)\n21.8 (5.1)\n71.5 (28.1)\n10.5 (5.6)\n21.7 (7.3)\n- (-)\n46.4 (3.0)\n2.6 (1.6)\n22.0 (0.2)\n19.1 (5.8)\n15.7 (5.7)\n128.4 (27.8)\n342.3 (66.3)\n35.0 (5.5)\n29.7 (5.0)\n107.6 (9.3)\n12.1 (7.7)\n170.9 (42.9)\n144.6 (132.3)\n21.4 (17.1)\n31.5 (20.4)\n101.9 (19.8)\n19.7 (6.1)\n4.0 (3.5)\n27.1 (3.6)\n76.6 (21.9)\n7.6 (4.8)\n15.0 (0)\n31.2 (0.3)\n6.4 (0.1)\n10.9 (0.3)\n47.5 (4.6)\n6.5 (0.2)\n21.5 (1.9)\n22.8 (1.5)\n8.6 (0.7)\n19.6 (1.8)\n108.6 (6.5)\n16.5 (0.5)\n1.3 (0.1)\n9.5 (0.1)\n37.4 (5.9)\n7.9 (0.4)\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\n0\n30\n30\n30\n30\n30\nTable 2: Number of evaluations to find a first feasible point.

In our experiments,\nthe number of candidates is chosen equal to the population size mX= 1000 of the SMC method.\nTable 7 presents experimental results obtained with the extended EHVI criterion proposed in Section 3\nas a sampling criterion. As a preliminary remark, observe that the finest target precision is systematically\nreached by our SMC method in all but three test cases (OSY, TwoBarTruss and WeldedBeam). The\nOSY case will be discussed below. On the TwoBarTruss and WeldedBeam problems, we found out that\nthe poor performances are due to Gaussian process modeling issues, similar to those encountered earlier\non the g3mod, g10 and PVD4 test problems (see Section 5.3). The results on these problems are thus\nleft out of the analyses in the following, but will motivate future work on the models, as concluded\nin Section 5.3. Regarding the optimization of the criteria, the results show that our SMC approach\ncompares very favorably with MCSQP. More specifically, we note a drop of performance of the MCSQP\nmethod compared with the SMC approach as we try to converge more finely toward the Pareto front\n(see, in particular, column \u201cTarget 99%\u201d of Table 7, but this is also visible in the other columns as well\nfor most of the test cases). Because of its sequential nature, the SMC approach is able to track much\nmore efficiently the concentration of the sampling criterion in the search domain, and thus makes it\npossible to reach higher accuracy.\nTables 8 and 9 provide additional results obtained when performing the same study with respectively the\nEMMI and WCPI criteria9(see Svenson and Santner, 2010; Keane, 2006, respectively). These criteria\nare not primarily designed to address constrained problems, but they can easily be extended to handle\nconstraints by calculating them using only feasible values of the objectives, and then multiplying them\nby the probability of satisfying the constraints (as explained in Section 2.3). When no feasible solution\nis available at the start of the optimization procedure, we use the probability of feasibility as a sampling\ncriterion, as advised by Gelbart et al. (2014). The conclusions drawn from Table 7 for the extended EHVI\ncriterion carry through to the results presented in Tables 8\u20139. It shows that the SMC algorithm proposed\nin Section 4.2 can be viewed as a contribution of independent interest for optimizing improvement-based\nsampling criteria.\nNext we study the influence on the convergence of the algorithm of the number m = mYof particles used\nin Algorithm 1 for approximating the expected improvement value. In Table 10 we compare the number\nof evaluations required to dominate successively 90%, 95% and 99% of the volume V of Table 6 when\nusing different numbers of particles. As expected, the overall performances of the algorithm deteriorate\nwhen the number mY of particles used to approximate the expected improvement decreases. However,\nthe algorithm maintains satisfactory convergence properties even with a small number of particles. For\nreference, we have also included results obtained by choosing the evaluation point randomly in the set\nof candidate points. Notice that these results are always much worse than those obtained using the\nsampling criterion with mY= 200. This shows that not all candidate points are equally good, and thus\nconfirms that the sampling criterion, even with a rather small value of mY, is effectively discriminating\nbetween good and bad candidate points.\nWe observe poor performances of the BMOO algorithm on the OSY test problem, regardless of the\nnumber of particles that are used to estimate the expected improvement. Figure 8 reveals that this is\ndue to the choice of a uniform sampling density on Bo\\Hnas the target density of the SMC algorithm\nused for the approximate computation of the criterion. Indeed, most of the particles do not effectively\nparticipate to the approximation of the integral, since they lie outside the set of feasible objective values\n(see Figure 7(d)). Further work is required on this topic to propose a better sampling density, that would\n9An implementation of the EMMI criterion is available in the STK.

The constraints are handled using an extended domination rule\nand a new expected improvement formulation is proposed. In particular, the new formulation makes it\npossible to deal with problems where no feasible solution is available from the start. Several criteria from\nthe literature are recovered as special cases.\nThe computation and optimization of the new expected improvement criterion are carried out using\nsequential Monte Carlo sampling techniques.

The proposed sampling techniques borrow ideas from\nthe literature of structural reliability for estimating the probability of rare events, and can be viewed as\na contribution in itself.\nWe show that the resulting algorithm, which we call BMOO, achieves good results on a set of single-\nobjective constrained test problems, with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, BMOO\nis able to effectively find feasible solutions, even when the feasible region is very small compared to\nthe size of the search space and when the number of constraints is high. In the case of multi-objective\noptimization with non-linear constraints, we show that BMOO is able to yield good approximations of\nthe Pareto front on small budgets of evaluations.\nSeveral questions are left open for future work. First, our numerical studies reveal that the choice\nof sampling densities in the input domain (as demonstrated by unsatisfactory results on the g18 test\nproblem) and in the output domain (as shown on the OSY case) could be improved. Suggestions for\nimprovement are proposed in the article and will be the object of future investigations. Second, an in-\ndepth study of the quality of the approximation provided by our SMC method, and a comparison with\nexact methods, is needed before recommandations can be made on when to switch between exact and\napproximate calculation of the expected improvement, and how to select the sample size\u2014possibly in\nan adaptive manner\u2014used for the SMC approximation.

As said in Section 3.3, these hyper-rectangles are defined using estimates of the range of the objective\nand constraint functions, respectively. To this end, we will use the available evaluations results, together with posterior\nquantiles provided by our Gaussian process models on the set of candidate points Xn (defined in Section 4.2).\nMore precisely, assume that n evaluation results \u03be(Xi), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, are available. Then, we define the corners of Bo by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f3\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p, and the corners of Bc by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f3\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 q, where \u03bbo and \u03bbc are positive numbers.\n\uf8f2\nylow\no,i,n= min\nyupp\no,i,n= max\n?\nmini\u2264n\u03beo,i(Xi), minx\u2208Xn?\u03beo, i, n(x) \u2212 \u03bbo\u03c3o, i, n(x)\n?\n,\n?\nmaxi\u2264n\u03beo,i(Xi), maxx\u2208Xn?\u03beo, i, n(x) + \u03bbo\u03c3o, i, n(x)\n?\n,\n(36)\n\uf8f2\nylow\nc,j,n= min\nyupp\nc,j,n= max\n?\n0, mini\u2264n\u03bec,j(Xi), minx\u2208Xn?\u03bec, j, n(x) \u2212 \u03bbc\u03c3c, j, n(x)\n?\n,\n?\n0, maxi\u2264n\u03bec,j(Xi), maxx\u2208Xn?\u03bec, j, n(x) + \u03bbc\u03c3c, j, n(x)\n?\n,\n(37)\nC Mono-objective benchmark result tables\nIn Section 5.3, only the best results for both the \u201cLocal\u201d and the \u201cRegis\u201d groups of algorithms were shown. In this Appendix,\nwe present the full results.

Table 11 and Table 12 show the performances for finding feasible solutions and for reaching the targets specified\nin Table 1 for the COBYLA, Active-Set, Interior-Point and SQP algorithms. Similarly, Table 13 and Table 14 show\nthe performances for finding feasible solutions and for reaching the targets for the COBRA-Local, COBRA-Global and\nExtended-ConstrLMSRBF algorithms of Regis (2014).\nD Modified g3mod, g10 and PVD4 test problems\nWe detail here the modified formulations of the g3mod, g10 and PVD4 problems that were used in Section 5.3 to overcome\nthe modeling problems with BMOO.
