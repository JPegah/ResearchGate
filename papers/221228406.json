{"abstract":"ABSTRACT In engineering and other 'real-world' applications, multiobjective opti- mization problems must frequently be tackled on a tight evaluation budget รณ tens or hundreds of function evaluations, rather than thousands. In this paper, we in- vestigate two algorithms that use advanced initialization and search strategies to operate better under these conditions. The rst algorithm, Bin MSOPS, uses a bi- nary search tree to divide up the decision space, and tries to sample from the largest empty regions near 't' solutions. The second algorithm, ParEGO, begins with so- lutions in a latin hypercube and updates a Gaussian processes surrogate model of the search landscape after every function evaluation, which it uses to estimate the solution of largest expected improvement. The two algorithms are tested using a benchmark suite of nine functions of two and three objectives รณ on a budget of only 250 function evaluations each, in total. Results indicate that the two algo- rithms search the space in very different ways and this can be used to understand performance differences. Both algorithms perform well but ParEGO comes out on top in seven of the nine test cases after 100 function evaluations, and on six after the rst 250 evaluations.","authors":[],"title":"Multiobjective Optimization on a Budget of 250 Evaluations","pub_id":221228406,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/221228406_Multiobjective_Optimization_on_a_Budget_of_250_Evaluations"}
