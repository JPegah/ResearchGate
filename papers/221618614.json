{"abstract":"ABSTRACT This contribution develops a theoretical framework that takes into account the effect of approximate optimization on learning algorithms. The analysis shows distinct tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-sc ale learning problems. Small-scale learning problems are subject to the usual approximation-estimation tradeoff. Large-scale learning problems are subject to a qualitatively different tradeoff involving the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithms in non-trivial ways.","authors":["LÃ©on Bottou"],"title":"The Tradeoffs of Large Scale Learning.","pub_id":221618614,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/221618614_The_Tradeoffs_of_Large_Scale_Learning"}
