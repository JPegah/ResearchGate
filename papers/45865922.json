{"abstract":"ABSTRACT We propose a nonparametric Bayesian factor regression model that accounts for uncertainty in the number of factors, and the relationship between factors. To accomplish this, we propose a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors, based on Kingman's coalescent. We apply this model to two problems (factor analysis and factor regression) in gene-expression data analysis.","authors":["Hal Daum√© III"],"title":"The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model","_id":45865922,"citee":[2522345,7401713,6825348,8361318,228373683,2670104,220320482,6486241,220270203,45860527,2874321,49739891,223115706,221620549,220848162,221619194,4740904],"citedBy":[224943896,224246550,51911586,221344846,221346491,227113488,47300906,45914785,215990277,221346465,221618878,221404757,228670244,255564616,221618506,221619773,220320251,47843669,221346101,220320085,220320991,236909443,261241469,254026336,261479296,271557004,259695356,268689650,273171263,279309917],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/45865922_The_Infinite_Hierarchical_Factor_Regression_Model"}
