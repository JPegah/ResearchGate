{"abstract":"ABSTRACT We propose a nonparametric Bayesian factor regression model that accounts for uncertainty in the number of factors, and the relationship between factors. To accomplish this, we propose a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors, based on Kingman's coalescent. We apply this model to two problems (factor analysis and factor regression) in gene-expression data analysis.","authors":["Hal Daum√© III"],"title":"The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model","pub_id":45865922,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/45865922_The_Infinite_Hierarchical_Factor_Regression_Model"}
