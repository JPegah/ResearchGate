{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Concentration inequalities quantify the deviation of a random variable from a fixed value. In spite of numerous applications, such as opinion surveys or ecological counting procedures, few concentration results are known for the setting of sampling without replacement from a finite population. Until now, the best general concentration inequality has been a Hoeffding inequality due to Serfling (1974). In this paper, we first improve on the fundamental result of Serfling (1974), and further extend it to obtain a Bernstein concentration bound for sampling without replacement. We then derive an empirical version of our bound that does not require the variance to be known to the user.","authors":["RÃ©mi Bardenet"],"title":"Concentration inequalities for sampling without replacement","_id":256606492,"citee":[228057769,41781172,220357686,38357750,45863486,232128642,220345492,221996154,244506454,220151284,236240995],"citedBy":[280589611,280589952,267759898,264708143,268747974,279633530,280970148],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement"}
