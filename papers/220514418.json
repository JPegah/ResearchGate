{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Surrogate-assisted, or meta-model based evolutionary computation uses efficient computational models, often known as surrogates or meta-models, for approximating the fitness function in evolutionary algorithms. Research on surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation began over a decade ago and has received considerably increasing interest in recent years. Very interestingly, surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation has found successful applications not only in solving computationally expensive single- or multi-objective optimization problems, but also in addressing dynamic optimization problems, constrained optimization problems and multi-modal optimization problems. This paper provides a concise overview of the history and recent developments in surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation and suggests a few future trends in this research area.","authors":[],"title":"Surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation: Recent advances and future challenges","pub_id":220514418,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/220514418_Surrogate-assisted_evolutionary_computation_Recent_advances_and_future_challenges"}
