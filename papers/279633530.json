{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Drawing a sample from a discrete distribution is one of the building components for Monte Carlo methods. Like other sampling algorithms, discrete sampling also suffers from high computational burden in large-scale inference problems. We study the problem of sampling a discrete random variable with a high degree of dependency that is typical in large-scale Bayesian inference and graphical models, and propose an efficient approximate solution with a subsampling approach. We make a novel connection between the discrete sampling and Multi-Armed Bandits problems with a finite reward population and provide three algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations show the robustness and efficiency of the approximate algorithms in both synthetic and real-world large-scale problems.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"title":"Subsampling-Based Approximate Monte Carlo for Discrete Distributions","_id":279633530,"citee":[224175402,221346425,236235190,256606492,262350854,221618614,220286498,2360567,259478458,38357750,239551242,2779476,266660385,221996154,225209253,220343796,221111135,215470704,264948136,262030260,235709950,38350870,243764505,220320734],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/279633530_Subsampling-Based_Approximate_Monte_Carlo_for_Discrete_Distributions?ev=auth_pub"}
