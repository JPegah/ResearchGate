{"abstract":"We present a new variational inference algorithm for Gaussian process regres-sion with non-conjugate likelihood functions, with application to a wide array of problems including binary and multi-class classification, and ordinal regression. Our method constructs a concave lower bound that is optimized using an efficient fixed-point updating algorithm. We show that the new algorithm has highly com-petitive computational complexity, matching that of alternative approximate infer-ence methods. We also prove that the use of concave variational bounds provides stable and guaranteed convergence \u2013 a property not available to other approaches. We show empirically for both binary and multi-class classification that our new algorithm converges much faster than existing variational methods, and without any degradation in performance.","authors":["Shakir Mohamed","Kevin P Murphy"],"title":"Fast Bayesian Inference for Non-Conjugate Gaussian Process Regression","_id":266502061,"citee":[41781800,23252767,220320078,46537493,251955941,220499817,41781828,267947119,41781429,51912644,242530111,1903443,226826572,226627927],"citedBy":[278332447],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/266502061_Fast_Bayesian_Inference_for_Non-Conjugate_Gaussian_Process_Regression"}
