{"abstract":"This paper concerns multiobjective optimization in scenarios where each solution evaluation is financially and\/or temporally expensive. We make use of nine relatively low-dimensional, nonpathological, real-valued functions, such as arise in many applications, and assess the performance of two algorithms after just 100 and 250 (or 260) function evaluations. The results show that NSGA-II, a popular multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, performs well compared with random search, even within the restricted number of evaluations used. A significantly better performance (particularly, in the worst case) is, however, achieved on our test set by an algorithm proposed herein-ParEGO-which is an extension of the single-objective efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm of Jones et al. ParEGO uses a design-of-experiments inspired initialization procedure and learns a Gaussian processes model of the search landscape, which is updated after every function evaluation. Overall, ParEGO exhibits a promising performance for multiobjective optimization problems where evaluations are expensive or otherwise restricted in number.","authors":[],"title":"ParEGO: A Hybrid Algorithm With On-Line Landscape Approximation for Expension Multiobjective Optimization Problems","pub_id":3418871,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/3418871_ParEGO_A_Hybrid_Algorithm_With_On-Line_Landscape_Approximation_for_Expension_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems"}
