{"abstract":"This paper focuses on a particular algorithm, Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) that uses kriging metamodels. Several infill sampling criteria are reviewed, namely criteria for selecting the points added to the data set for fitting the metamodel. The infill sampling criterion has a strong influence on how efficiently and accurately EGO locates the optimum. Variance-reducing criteria substantially reduce the RMS error of the resulting metamodels, while other criteria influence how locally or globally EGO searches. Criteria that place more emphasis on global searching require more iterations to locate optima and do so less accurately than criteria emphasizing local search","authors":["Panos Papalambros"],"title":"Exploration of Metamodeling Sampling Criteria for Constrained Global Optimization","pub_id":216301383,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/216301383_Exploration_of_Metamodeling_Sampling_Criteria_for_Constrained_Global_Optimization"}
