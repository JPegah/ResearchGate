{"abstract":"ABSTRACT In the design and analysis of large-scale simulation experiments, it is generally difficult to estimate model performance parameters with adequate precision at an acceptable sampling cost. This paper provides a state-of-the-art survey of the principal variance reduction techniques that can improve the efficiency of such experiments.","authors":[],"title":"Variance Reduction Techniques for Digital Simulation","pub_id":239551242,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/239551242_Variance_Reduction_Techniques_for_Digital_Simulation"}
