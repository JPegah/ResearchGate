{"abstract":"A nonparametric Bayesian extension of Factor Analysis (FA) is proposed where observed data $\\mathbf{Y}$ is modeled as a linear superposition, $\\mathbf{G}$, of a potentially infinite number of hidden factors, $\\mathbf{X}$. The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is used as a prior on $\\mathbf{G}$ to incorporate sparsity and to allow the number of latent features to be inferred. The model's utility for modeling gene expression data is investigated using randomly generated data sets based on a known sparse connectivity matrix for E. Coli, and on three biological data sets of increasing complexity.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"title":"Nonparametric Bayesian sparse factor models with application to gene expression modeling","_id":47843669,"citee":[8943768,221605376,24308004,221618787,46163720,3457693,220848162,221619194,221404757,221619773,220270203,45865922,5175443,224881840,252461885,8455580],"citedBy":[279309917,274012431,268451692,263699364,244989732,257308543,256472434,251495519,220319862,51927792,230742138,234040833,233409501,262160649,257618582,257882903,259695356,262022360,264241425,264641465,266944334,278316392,284950464,273472293,279806620,280595734],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/47843669_Nonparametric_Bayesian_sparse_factor_models_with_application_to_geneexpression_modeling"}
