{"abstract":"Real-world optimization problems often require the consideration of multiple contradicting objectives. These multiobjective problems are even more challenging when facing a limited budget of evaluations due to expensive experiments or simulations. In these cases, a specific class of multiobjective optimization algorithms (MOOA) has to be applied. This paper provides a review of contemporary multiobjective approaches based on the singleobjective meta-model-assisted \u2019Efficient Global Optimization\u2019 (EGO) procedure and describes their main concepts. Additionally, a new EGO-based MOOA is introduced, which utilizes the S\\mathcal{S} -metric or hypervolume contribution to decide which solution is evaluated next. A benchmark on recently proposed test functions is performed allowing a budget of 130 evaluations. The results point out that the maximization of the hypervolume contribution within a real multiobjective optimization is superior to straightforward adaptations of EGO making our new approach capable of approximating the Pareto front of common problems within the allowed budget of evaluations.","authors":["Markus Vincze"],"title":"Multiobjective Optimization on a Limited Budget of Evaluations Using Model-Assisted $\\mathcal{S}$ -Metric Selection","pub_id":220702165,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/220702165_Multiobjective_Optimization_on_a_Limited_Budget_of_Evaluations_Using_Model-Assisted_mathcalS_-Metric_Selection"}
