{"abstract":"ABSTRACT A nonparametric Bayesian extension of Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is proposed where observed data Y is modelled as a linear superposition, G, of a potentially infinite number of hidden sources, X. Whether a given source is active for a specific data point is specified by an infinite binary matrix, Z. The resulting sparse representation allows increased data reduction compared to standard ICA. We define a prior on Z using the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). We describe four variants of the model, with Gaussian or Laplacian priors on X and the one or two-parameter IBPs. We demonstrate Bayesian inference under these models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on synthetic and gene expression data and compare to standard ICA algorithms.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"title":"Infinite Sparse Factor Analysis and Infinite Independent Components Analysis","_id":220848162,"citee":[220279494,229647197,6265760,220270203,227661917,2242002,221619194,2348531,2611505,228373683],"citedBy":[260623423,230996489,239938718,51948589,224246550,47843669,227113488,45914785,224114445,221346465,220320877,221618878,221619853,264886451,266017041,238508763,221617836,229100473,45865922,221344846,220320991,220320085,51967555,51945698,220124406,224242654,220848202,230859133,232275982,262280369,233720862,257879212,235438734,234019992,258792317,261479296,256424823,260080562,257882903,262363646,260439271,263508782,267099505,279309917],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/220848162_Infinite_Sparse_Factor_Analysis_and_Infinite_Independent_Components_Analysis"}
