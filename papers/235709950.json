{"abstract":"ABSTRACT In this paper sequential procedures are given for selecting the normal population with the greatest mean when (a) the $k$ populations have a common known variance or (b) the $k$ populations have a common but unknown variance, so that in each case the probability of making the correct selection exceeds a specified value when the greatest mean exceeds all other means by at least a specified amount. The procedures in the present paper all have the property that inferior populations can be eliminated from further consideration as the experiment proceeds.","authors":["Edward Paulson"],"title":"A Sequential Procedure for Selecting the Population with the Largest Mean from $k$ Normal Populations","_id":235709950,"citee":[],"citedBy":[279633530,259478458,265830785,257196296,257199330,227936002,220258688,4249986,221528942,4213819,228649249,222554257,3933190,216301254,2471963,2510889,2508196,232354825,254210211,46267534,228588888,32146266,267771705,235208945,38365360,38365050,38364908,225400714,38364273,243037125,241680754,243048757,243042431,235122320,234464980,233005580,242356630,267150614,216300683,241721627,246901674,232863610,266551094,216300682,234803958,238866273,232835019,277102632,216300212,21323545,233343395,245495775,233230797,232902213,3192431,2762780,230265429,38348718,13966979,3933240,245496050,11052450,221526197,221528621,8220460,220136266,221529860,7722910,5207357,228041122,238865423,228954846,216300130,4213843,245495801,227733113,232885135,228368113,263651135,221529168,23258473,242713705,45151889,232892691,233066463,224123853,241635554,51915959,261302752,236263970,260516394,233849557,253239677,269330671,270697909,275622872],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/235709950_A_Sequential_Procedure_for_Selecting_the_Population_with_the_Largest_Mean_from_k_Normal_Populations"}
