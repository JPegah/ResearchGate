{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Nonparametric Bayesian models provide a framework for flexi ble probabilistic modelling of complex datasets. Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages re- quired for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded repre- sentations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world appli- cations. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Ind ian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features. Our novel MCMC sampler divides a large data set between multiple processors and uses message passing to compute the global likelihoods and pos- teriors. This algorithm, the first parallel inference schem e for IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders of magnitude larger than have previously been possible.","authors":["Shakir Mohamed","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"title":"Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process","_id":221620392,"citee":[26620182,221023517,220320194,220270203,220320786,220320877,221617998,226539729,221619731,45622656,4326514,224557571,221617800,221619032,221619194,221345696],"citedBy":[279309917,221346491,253330276],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/221620392_Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process"}
