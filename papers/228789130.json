{"abstract":"ABSTRACT We investigate the use of adaptive MCMC algorithms to automatically tune the Markov chain parameters during a run. Examples include the Adaptive Metropolis (AM) multivariate algorithm of Haario, Saksman, and Tamminen (2001), Metropoliswithin- Gibbs algorithms for nonconjugate hierarchical models, regionally adjusted Metropolis algorithms, and logarithmic scalings. Computer simulations indicate that the algorithms perform very well compared to nonadaptive algorithms, even in high dimension.
