{"abstract":"This article develops two new algorithms for constrained expensive black-box optimization that use radial basis function surrogates for the objective and constraint functions. These algorithms are called COBRA and Extended ConstrLMSRBF and, unlike previous surrogate-based approaches, they can be used for high-dimensional problems where all initial points are infeasible. They both follow a two-phase approach where the first phase finds a feasible point while the second phase improves this feasible point. COBRA and Extended ConstrLMSRBF are compared with alternative methods on 20 test problems and on the MOPTA08 benchmark automotive problem (D.R. Jones, Presented at MOPTA 2008), which has 124 decision variables and 68 black-box inequality constraints. The alternatives include a sequential penalty derivative-free algorithm, a direct search method with kriging surrogates, and two multistart methods. Numerical results show that COBRA algorithms are competitive with Extended ConstrLMSRBF and they generally outperform the alternatives on the MOPTA08 problem and most of the test problems.","authors":[],"title":"Constrained optimization by radial basis function interpolation for high-dimensional expensive black-box problems with infeasible initial points","pub_id":263244902,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/263244902_Constrained_optimization_by_radial_basis_function_interpolation_for_high-dimensional_expensive_black-box_problems_with_infeasible_initial_points"}
