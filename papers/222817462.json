{"abstract":"ABSTRACT The ill-posed nature of missing variable models offers a challenging testing ground for new computational techniques. This is the case for the mean-field variational Bayesian inference. The behavior of this approach in the setting of the Bayesian probit model is illustrated. It is shown that the mean-field variational method always underestimates the posterior variance and, that, for small sample sizes, the mean-field variational approximation to the posterior location could be poor.","authors":["Jean-Michel Marin"],"title":"Mean-field variational approximate Bayesian inference for latent variable models","pub_id":222817462,"citee":[],"citedBy":[],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/222817462_Mean-field_variational_approximate_Bayesian_inference_for_latent_variable_models"}
