{"abstract":"ABSTRACT The ill-posed nature of missing variable models offers a challenging testing ground for new computational techniques. This is the case for the mean-field variational Bayesian inference. The behavior of this approach in the setting of the Bayesian probit model is illustrated. It is shown that the mean-field variational method always underestimates the posterior variance and, that, for small sample sizes, the mean-field variational approximation to the posterior location could be poor.","authors":["Jean-Michel Marin"],"title":"Mean-field variational approximate Bayesian inference for latent variable models","_id":222817462,"citee":[242530111,43500603,33020867,34000771,245581819,221995760,229157636,40498220,224881759,45622656,2433253,245433572,200744518,247584716,2495015,2367988,2518209,239049889,261593363,226435002,268209561,252636563,200033837,234140148,265429604,2488581],"citedBy":[256662994,224176534,237824926,234797878,224577532,44843129,220055844,220056356,220327056,254212653,230859240,264252319,228678681,268066745,279309917,279458734,289695017],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/222817462_Mean-field_variational_approximate_Bayesian_inference_for_latent_variable_models"}
