{"abstract":"We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning. Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic back-propagation -- rules for back-propagation through stochastic variables -- and use this to develop an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.","authors":["Shakir Mohamed","Daan Wierstra"],"title":"Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models","_id":262991675,"citee":[259578079,279964320,239551242,23252767,267706055,228095632,1961033,13338024],"citedBy":[284579582,284476621,284219020,284218872,284476463,284476380,284218982,284219537,283532090,283433446,282181295,281487457,278733876,278413644,278332468,277959228,277603643,277334014,275669544,275588265,273471664,273388187,273158161,267338836,259400035,260022128,260022580,263012109,263048596,266396723,268689301,276933759,277023095,277023018,277959103,277959252,277959098,278048531,279310087,281312203,282310243,284476551,284476202,289587906],"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/262991675_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models"}
