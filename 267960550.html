On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5%<br />and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The<br />neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists<br />of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,<br />and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-<br />ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-<br />tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected<br />layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout”<br />that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the<br />ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,<br />compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.<br />1 Introduction<br />Current approaches to object recognition make essential use of machine learning methods. To im-<br />prove their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use bet-<br />ter techniques for preventing overfitting. Until recently, datasets of labeled images were relatively<br />small — on the order of tens of thousands of images (e.g., NORB [16], Caltech-101/256 [8, 9], and<br />CIFAR-10/100 [12]). Simple recognition tasks can be solved quite well with datasets of this size,<br />especially if they are augmented with label-preserving transformations. For example, the current-<br />best error rate on the MNIST digit-recognition task (&lt;0.3%) approaches human performance [4].<br />But objects in realistic settings exhibit considerable variability, so to learn to recognize them it is<br />necessary to use much larger training sets. And indeed, the shortcomings of small image datasets<br />have been widely recognized (e.g., Pinto et al. [21]), but it has only recently become possible to col-<br />lect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which<br />consists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of<br />over 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories.<br />To learn about thousands of objects from millions of images, we need a model with a large learning<br />capacity. However, the immense complexity of the object recognition task means that this prob-<br />lem cannot be specified even by a dataset as large as ImageNet, so our model should also have lots<br />of prior knowledge to compensate for all the data we don’t have. Convolutional neural networks<br />(CNNs) constitute one such class of models [16, 11, 13, 18, 15, 22, 26]. Their capacity can be con-<br />trolled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions<br />about the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies).<br />Thus, compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers, CNNs have<br />much fewer connections and parameters and so they are easier to train, while their theoretically-best<br />performance is likely to be only slightly worse.<br />1</p>  <p>Page 2</p> <p>Despite the attractive qualities of CNNs, and despite the relative efficiency of their local architecture,<br />they have still been prohibitively expensive to apply in large scale to high-resolution images. Luck-<br />ily, current GPUs, paired with a highly-optimized implementation of 2D convolution, are powerful<br />enough to facilitate the training of interestingly-large CNNs, and recent datasets such as ImageNet<br />contain enough labeled examples to train such models without severe overfitting.<br />The specific contributions of this paper are as follows: we trained one of the largest convolutional<br />neural networks to date on the subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012<br />competitions [2] and achieved by far the best results ever reported on these datasets. We wrote a<br />highly-optimized GPU implementation of 2D convolution and all the other operations inherent in<br />training convolutional neural networks, which we make available publicly1. Our network contains<br />a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time,<br />which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even<br />with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing<br />overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and<br />three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any<br />convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model’s parameters) resulted in<br />inferior performance.<br />In the end, the network’s size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs<br />and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five<br />and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results<br />can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.<br />2 The Dataset<br />ImageNet is a dataset of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000<br />categories. The images were collected from the web and labeled by human labelers using Ama-<br />zon’s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool. Starting in 2010, as part of the Pascal Visual Object<br />Challenge, an annual competition called the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge<br />(ILSVRC) has been held. ILSVRC uses a subset of ImageNet with roughly 1000 images in each of<br />1000 categories. In all, there are roughly 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and<br />150,000 testing images.<br />ILSVRC-2010 is the only version of ILSVRC for which the test set labels are available, so this is<br />the version on which we performed most of our experiments. Since we also entered our model in<br />the ILSVRC-2012 competition, in Section 6 we report our results on this version of the dataset as<br />well, for which test set labels are unavailable. On ImageNet, it is customary to report two error rates:<br />top-1 and top-5, where the top-5 error rate is the fraction of test images for which the correct label<br />is not among the five labels considered most probable by the model.<br />ImageNet consists of variable-resolution images, while our system requires a constant input dimen-<br />sionality. Therefore, we down-sampled the images to a fixed resolution of 256 × 256. Given a<br />rectangular image, we first rescaled the image such that the shorter side was of length 256, and then<br />cropped out the central 256×256 patch from the resulting image. We did not pre-process the images<br />in any other way, except for subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. So<br />we trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels.<br />3 The Architecture<br />The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers —<br />five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual<br />features of our network’s architecture. Sections 3.1-3.4 are sorted according to our estimation of<br />their importance, with the most important first.<br />1http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/<br />2</p>  <p>Page 3</p> <p>3.1ReLU Nonlinearity<br />Figure 1: A four-layer convolutional neural<br />network with ReLUs (solid line) reaches a 25%<br />training error rate on CIFAR-10 six times faster<br />than an equivalent network with tanh neurons<br />(dashed line). The learning rates for each net-<br />work were chosen independently to make train-<br />ing as fast as possible. No regularization of<br />any kind was employed. The magnitude of the<br />effect demonstrated here varies with network<br />architecture, but networks with ReLUs consis-<br />tently learn several times faster than equivalents<br />with saturating neurons.<br />The standard way to model a neuron’s output f as<br />a function of its input x is with f(x) = tanh(x)<br />or f(x) = (1 + e−x)−1. In terms of training time<br />with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities<br />are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity<br />f(x) = max(0,x). Following Nair and Hinton [20],<br />we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified<br />Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural net-<br />works with ReLUs train several times faster than their<br />equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in<br />Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations re-<br />quired to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10<br />dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional net-<br />work. This plot shows that we would not have been<br />able to experiment with such large neural networks for<br />this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron<br />models.<br />We are not the first to consider alternatives to tradi-<br />tional neuron models in CNNs. For example, Jarrett<br />etal.[11]claimthatthenonlinearityf(x) = |tanh(x)|<br />works particularly well with their type of contrast nor-<br />malization followed by local average pooling on the<br />Caltech-101 dataset. However, on this dataset the pri-<br />mary concern is preventing overfitting, so the effect<br />they are observing is different from the accelerated<br />ability to fit the training set which we report when us-<br />ing ReLUs. Faster learning has a great influence on the<br />performance of large models trained on large datasets.<br />3.2Training on Multiple GPUs<br />A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks<br />that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks<br />which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs<br />are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to<br />one another’s memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization<br />scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one<br />additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the<br />kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input<br />only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of<br />connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of<br />communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation.<br />The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the “columnar” CNN employed by Cire¸ san<br />et al. [5], except that our columns are not independent (see Figure 2). This scheme reduces our top-1<br />and top-5 error rates by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively, as compared with a net with half as many<br />kernels in each convolutional layer trained on one GPU. The two-GPU net takes slightly less time<br />to train than the one-GPU net2.<br />2The one-GPU net actually has the same number of kernels as the two-GPU net in the final convolutional<br />layer. This is because most of the net’s parameters are in the first fully-connected layer, which takes the last<br />convolutional layer as input. So to make the two nets have approximately the same number of parameters, we<br />did not halve the size of the final convolutional layer (nor the fully-conneced layers which follow). Therefore<br />this comparison is biased in favor of the one-GPU net, since it is bigger than “half the size” of the two-GPU<br />net.<br />3</p>  <p>Page 4</p> <p>3.3 Local Response Normalization<br />ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them<br />from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will<br />happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids<br />generalization. Denoting by ai<br />(x,y) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity bi<br />the expression<br /><br />j=max(0,i−n/2)<br />where the sum runs over n “adjacent” kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total<br />number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined<br />before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition<br />inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron<br />outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k,n,α, and β are hyper-parameters whose<br />values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2, n = 5, α = 10−4, and β = 0.75. We<br />applied this normalization after applying the ReLU nonlinearity in certain layers (see Section 3.5).<br />This scheme bears some resemblance to the local contrast normalization scheme of Jarrett et al. [11],<br />but ours would be more correctly termed “brightness normalization”, since we do not subtract the<br />mean activity. Response normalization reduces our top-1 and top-5 error rates by 1.4% and 1.2%,<br />respectively. We also verified the effectiveness of this scheme on the CIFAR-10 dataset: a four-layer<br />CNN achieved a 13% test error rate without normalization and 11% with normalization3.<br />x,ythe activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position<br />x,yis given by<br />bi<br />x,y= ai<br />x,y/<br />k + α<br />min(N−1,i+n/2)<br />?<br />(aj<br />x,y)2<br /><br /><br />β<br />3.4 Overlapping Pooling<br />Pooling layers in CNNs summarize the outputs of neighboring groups of neurons in the same kernel<br />map. Traditionally, the neighborhoods summarized by adjacent pooling units do not overlap (e.g.,<br />[17, 11, 4]). To be more precise, a pooling layer can be thought of as consisting of a grid of pooling<br />units spaced s pixels apart, each summarizing a neighborhood of size z × z centered at the location<br />of the pooling unit. If we set s = z, we obtain traditional local pooling as commonly employed<br />in CNNs. If we set s &lt; z, we obtain overlapping pooling. This is what we use throughout our<br />network, with s = 2 and z = 3. This scheme reduces the top-1 and top-5 error rates by 0.4% and<br />0.3%, respectively, as compared with the non-overlapping scheme s = 2,z = 2, which produces<br />output of equivalent dimensions. We generally observe during training that models with overlapping<br />pooling find it slightly more difficult to overfit.<br />3.5Overall Architecture<br />Now we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net<br />contains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three are fully-<br />connected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces<br />a distribution over the 1000 class labels. Our network maximizes the multinomial logistic regression<br />objective, which is equivalent to maximizing the average across training cases of the log-probability<br />of the correct label under the prediction distribution.<br />The kernels of the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected only to those kernel<br />maps in the previous layer which reside on the same GPU (see Figure 2). The kernels of the third<br />convolutional layer are connected to all kernel maps in the second layer. The neurons in the fully-<br />connected layers are connected to all neurons in the previous layer. Response-normalization layers<br />followthefirstandsecondconvolutionallayers. Max-poolinglayers, ofthekinddescribedinSection<br />3.4, follow both response-normalization layers as well as the fifth convolutional layer. The ReLU<br />non-linearity is applied to the output of every convolutional and fully-connected layer.<br />The first convolutional layer filters the 224×224×3 input image with 96 kernels of size 11×11×3<br />with a stride of 4 pixels (this is the distance between the receptive field centers of neighboring<br />3We cannot describe this network in detail due to space constraints, but it is specified precisely by the code<br />and parameter files provided here: http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/.<br />4</p>  <p>Page 5</p> <p>Figure 2: An illustration of the architecture of our CNN, explicitly showing the delineation of responsibilities<br />between the two GPUs. One GPU runs the layer-parts at the top of the figure while the other runs the layer-parts<br />at the bottom. The GPUs communicate only at certain layers. The network’s input is 150,528-dimensional, and<br />the number of neurons in the network’s remaining layers is given by 253,440–186,624–64,896–64,896–43,264–<br />4096–4096–1000.<br />neurons in a kernel map). The second convolutional layer takes as input the (response-normalized<br />and pooled) output of the first convolutional layer and filters it with 256 kernels of size 5 × 5 × 48.<br />The third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected to one another without any intervening<br />pooling or normalization layers. The third convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 ×<br />256 connected to the (normalized, pooled) outputs of the second convolutional layer. The fourth<br />convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192 , and the fifth convolutional layer has 256<br />kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192. The fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.<br />4 Reducing Overfitting<br />Our neural network architecture has 60 million parameters. Although the 1000 classes of ILSVRC<br />make each training example impose 10 bits of constraint on the mapping from image to label, this<br />turns out to be insufficient to learn so many parameters without considerable overfitting. Below, we<br />describe the two primary ways in which we combat overfitting.<br />4.1 Data Augmentation<br />The easiest and most common method to reduce overfitting on image data is to artificially enlarge<br />the dataset using label-preserving transformations (e.g., [25, 4, 5]). We employ two distinct forms<br />of data augmentation, both of which allow transformed images to be produced from the original<br />images with very little computation, so the transformed images do not need to be stored on disk.<br />In our implementation, the transformed images are generated in Python code on the CPU while the<br />GPU is training on the previous batch of images. So these data augmentation schemes are, in effect,<br />computationally free.<br />The first form of data augmentation consists of generating image translations and horizontal reflec-<br />tions. We do this by extracting random 224×224 patches (and their horizontal reflections) from the<br />256×256 images and training our network on these extracted patches4. This increases the size of our<br />training set by a factor of 2048, though the resulting training examples are, of course, highly inter-<br />dependent. Without this scheme, our network suffers from substantial overfitting, which would have<br />forced us to use much smaller networks. At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting<br />five 224 × 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal<br />reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network’s softmax<br />layer on the ten patches.<br />The second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in<br />training images. Specifically, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the<br />ImageNet training set. To each training image, we add multiples of the found principal components,<br />4This is the reason why the input images in Figure 2 are 224 × 224 × 3-dimensional.<br />5</p>  <p>Page 6</p> <p>with magnitudes proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues times a random variable drawn from<br />a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. Therefore to each RGB image pixel Ixy=<br />[IR<br />xy,IG<br />xy,IB<br />xy]Twe add the following quantity:<br />[p1,p2,p3][α1λ1,α2λ2,α3λ3]T<br />where piand λiare ith eigenvector and eigenvalue of the 3 × 3 covariance matrix of RGB pixel<br />values, respectively, and αiis the aforementioned random variable. Each αiis drawn only once<br />for all the pixels of a particular training image until that image is used for training again, at which<br />point it is re-drawn. This scheme approximately captures an important property of natural images,<br />namely, that object identity is invariant to changes in the intensity and color of the illumination. This<br />scheme reduces the top-1 error rate by over 1%.<br />4.2Dropout<br />Combining the predictions of many different models is a very successful way to reduce test errors<br />[1, 3], but it appears to be too expensive for big neural networks that already take several days<br />to train. There is, however, a very efficient version of model combination that only costs about a<br />factor of two during training. The recently-introduced technique, called “dropout” [10], consists<br />of setting to zero the output of each hidden neuron with probability 0.5. The neurons which are<br />“dropped out” in this way do not contribute to the forward pass and do not participate in back-<br />propagation. So every time an input is presented, the neural network samples a different architecture,<br />but all these architectures share weights. This technique reduces complex co-adaptations of neurons,<br />since a neuron cannot rely on the presence of particular other neurons. It is, therefore, forced to<br />learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the<br />other neurons. At test time, we use all the neurons but multiply their outputs by 0.5, which is a<br />reasonable approximation to taking the geometric mean of the predictive distributions produced by<br />the exponentially-many dropout networks.<br />We use dropout in the first two fully-connected layers of Figure 2. Without dropout, our network ex-<br />hibits substantial overfitting. Dropout roughly doubles the number of iterations required to converge.<br />Figure 3: 96 convolutional kernels of size<br />11×11×3learnedbythefirstconvolutional<br />layeronthe224×224×3inputimages. The<br />top 48 kernels were learned on GPU 1 while<br />the bottom 48 kernels were learned on GPU<br />2. See Section 6.1 for details.<br />5 Details of learning<br />We trained our models using stochastic gradient descent<br />with a batch size of 128 examples, momentum of 0.9, and<br />weight decay of 0.0005. We found that this small amount<br />of weight decay was important for the model to learn. In<br />other words, weight decay here is not merely a regularizer:<br />it reduces the model’s training error. The update rule for<br />weight w was<br />vi+1<br />:=0.9 · vi− 0.0005 · ? · wi− ? ·<br />wi+ vi+1<br />?∂L<br />∂w<br />??<br />wi<br />?<br />Di<br />wi+1<br />:=<br />where i is the iteration index, v is the momentum variable, ? is the learning rate, and<br />the average over the ith batch Diof the derivative of the objective with respect to w, evaluated at<br />wi.<br />We initialized the weights in each layer from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard de-<br />viation 0.01. We initialized the neuron biases in the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers,<br />as well as in the fully-connected hidden layers, with the constant 1. This initialization accelerates<br />the early stages of learning by providing the ReLUs with positive inputs. We initialized the neuron<br />biases in the remaining layers with the constant 0.<br />We used an equal learning rate for all layers, which we adjusted manually throughout training.<br />The heuristic which we followed was to divide the learning rate by 10 when the validation error<br />rate stopped improving with the current learning rate. The learning rate was initialized at 0.01 and<br />?<br />∂L<br />∂w<br />??<br />wi<br />?<br />Diis<br />6</p>  <p>Page 7</p> <p>reduced three times prior to termination. We trained the network for roughly 90 cycles through the<br />training set of 1.2 million images, which took five to six days on two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs.<br />6 Results<br />Our results on ILSVRC-2010 are summarized in Table 1. Our network achieves top-1 and top-5<br />test set error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%5. The best performance achieved during the ILSVRC-<br />2010 competition was 47.1% and 28.2% with an approach that averages the predictions produced<br />from six sparse-coding models trained on different features [2], and since then the best pub-<br />lished results are 45.7% and 25.7% with an approach that averages the predictions of two classi-<br />fiers trained on Fisher Vectors (FVs) computed from two types of densely-sampled features [24].<br />Model<br />Sparse coding [2]<br />SIFT + FVs [24]<br />CNN<br />Top-1<br />47.1%<br />45.7%<br />37.5%<br />Top-5<br />28.2%<br />25.7%<br />17.0%<br />Table 1: Comparison of results on ILSVRC-<br />2010 test set. In italics are best results<br />achieved by others.<br />We also entered our model in the ILSVRC-2012 com-<br />petition and report our results in Table 2. Since the<br />ILSVRC-2012 test set labels are not publicly available,<br />we cannot report test error rates for all the models that<br />we tried. In the remainder of this paragraph, we use<br />validation and test error rates interchangeably because<br />in our experience they do not differ by more than 0.1%<br />(see Table 2). The CNN described in this paper achieves<br />a top-5 error rate of 18.2%. Averaging the predictions<br />of five similar CNNs gives an error rate of 16.4%. Training one CNN, with an extra sixth con-<br />volutional layer over the last pooling layer, to classify the entire ImageNet Fall 2011 release<br />(15M images, 22K categories), and then “fine-tuning” it on ILSVRC-2012 gives an error rate of<br />16.6%. Averaging the predictions of two CNNs that were pre-trained on the entire Fall 2011 re-<br />lease with the aforementioned five CNNs gives an error rate of 15.3%. The second-best con-<br />test entry achieved an error rate of 26.2% with an approach that averages the predictions of sev-<br />eral classifiers trained on FVs computed from different types of densely-sampled features [7].<br />Finally, we also report our error<br />rates on the Fall 2009 version of<br />ImageNet with 10,184 categories<br />and 8.9 million images. On this<br />dataset we follow the convention<br />in the literature of using half of<br />the images for training and half<br />for testing. Since there is no es-<br />tablished test set, our split neces-<br />sarily differs from the splits used<br />by previous authors, but this does<br />not affect the results appreciably.<br />Our top-1 and top-5 error rates<br />on this dataset are 67.4% and<br />40.9%, attained by the net described above but with an additional, sixth convolutional layer over the<br />last pooling layer. The best published results on this dataset are 78.1% and 60.9% [19].<br />Model<br />SIFT + FVs [7]<br />1 CNN<br />5 CNNs<br />1 CNN*<br />7 CNNs*<br />Top-1 (val)<br />—<br />40.7%<br />38.1%<br />39.0%<br />36.7%<br />Top-5 (val)<br />—<br />18.2%<br />16.4%<br />16.6%<br />15.4%<br />Top-5 (test)<br />26.2%<br />—<br />16.4%<br />—<br />15.3%<br />Table 2: Comparison of error rates on ILSVRC-2012 validation and<br />test sets.

See Section 6 for details.<br />6.1 Qualitative Evaluations<br />Figure 3 shows the convolutional kernels learned by the network’s two data-connected layers. The<br />network has learned a variety of frequency- and orientation-selective kernels, as well as various col-<br />ored blobs. Notice the specialization exhibited by the two GPUs, a result of the restricted connec-<br />tivity described in Section 3.5. The kernels on GPU 1 are largely color-agnostic, while the kernels<br />on on GPU 2 are largely color-specific. This kind of specialization occurs during every run and is<br />independent of any particular random weight initialization (modulo a renumbering of the GPUs).<br />5The error rates without averaging predictions over ten patches as described in Section 4.1 are 39.0% and<br />18.3%.<br />7</p>  <p>Page 8</p> <p>Figure 4: (Left) Eight ILSVRC-2010 test images and the five labels considered most probable by our model.<br />The correct label is written under each image, and the probability assigned to the correct label is also shown<br />with a red bar (if it happens to be in the top 5). (Right) Five ILSVRC-2010 test images in the first column. The<br />remaining columns show the six training images that produce feature vectors in the last hidden layer with the<br />smallest Euclidean distance from the feature vector for the test image.<br />In the left panel of Figure 4 we qualitatively assess what the network has learned by computing its<br />top-5 predictions on eight test images. Notice that even off-center objects, such as the mite in the<br />top-left, can be recognized by the net. Most of the top-5 labels appear reasonable. For example,<br />only other types of cat are considered plausible labels for the leopard. In some cases (grille, cherry)<br />there is genuine ambiguity about the intended focus of the photograph.<br />Another way to probe the network’s visual knowledge is to consider the feature activations induced<br />by an image at the last, 4096-dimensional hidden layer. If two images produce feature activation<br />vectors with a small Euclidean separation, we can say that the higher levels of the neural network<br />consider them to be similar. Figure 4 shows five images from the test set and the six images from<br />the training set that are most similar to each of them according to this measure. Notice that at the<br />pixel level, the retrieved training images are generally not close in L2 to the query images in the first<br />column. For example, the retrieved dogs and elephants appear in a variety of poses. We present the<br />results for many more test images in the supplementary material.<br />Computing similarity by using Euclidean distance between two 4096-dimensional, real-valued vec-<br />torsisinefficient, butitcouldbemadeefficientbytraininganauto-encodertocompressthesevectors<br />to short binary codes. This should produce a much better image retrieval method than applying auto-<br />encoders to the raw pixels [14], which does not make use of image labels and hence has a tendency<br />to retrieve images with similar patterns of edges, whether or not they are semantically similar.<br />7 Discussion<br />Our results show that a large, deep convolutional neural network is capable of achieving record-<br />breaking results on a highly challenging dataset using purely supervised learning. It is notable<br />that our network’s performance degrades if a single convolutional layer is removed. For example,<br />removing any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the<br />network. So the depth really is important for achieving our results.<br />To simplify our experiments, we did not use any unsupervised pre-training even though we expect<br />that it will help, especially if we obtain enough computational power to significantly increase the<br />size of the network without obtaining a corresponding increase in the amount of labeled data. Thus<br />far, our results have improved as we have made our network larger and trained it longer but we still<br />have many orders of magnitude to go in order to match the infero-temporal pathway of the human<br />visual system. Ultimately we would like to use very large and deep convolutional nets on video<br />sequences where the temporal structure provides very helpful information that is missing or far less<br />obvious in static images.<br />8</p>  <p>Page 9</p> <p>References<br />[1] R.M.BellandY.Koren.

It is reported that robots can deeply understand visual scene information and describe the scenes in natural language using object recognition and natural language processing methods. Image-based question and answering (Q&amp;A) systems can be used for enhancing HRI. However, despite these successful results, several key issues still remain to be discussed and improved. In particular, it is essential for an agent to act in a dynamic, uncertain, and asynchronous environment for achieving human-level robot intelligence. In this paper, we propose a prototype system for a video Q&amp;A robot &quot; Pororobot &quot;. The system uses the state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as a deep concept hierarchy model. In our scenario, a robot and a child plays a video Q&amp;A game together under real world environments. Here we demonstrate preliminary results of the proposed system and discuss some directions as future works. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">   <span class="ico-publication-fulltext reset-background"></span> Full-text   &middot; Conference Paper &middot; Nov 2016  </div>        <div class="publication-actions"> <div class="btn-group">  <a class="btn btn-plain action-download primary  open-viewer" href="profile/Jung-Woo_Ha/publication/281859715_Pororobot_A_Deep_Learning_Robot_That_Plays_Video_QA_Games/links/55fbf32708aec948c4afb9bb.pdf?origin=publication_list">  <span class="js-btn-label">Download</span> </a>    </div> </div>      </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication   includes-citation-list"  id="rgw43_56ab1f1f44a70" >  <div class="indent-left">  <div id="rgw44_56ab1f1f44a70" class="js-publication-item-fulltext fulltext-thumb">    <a class="publication-preview ga-publication-viewer js-publication-item-fulltext-content" href="publication/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units">       </a>   <div class="preview-source-info"> <a class="details js-show-source ga-source-url" href="profile/Michel_Valstar" >Source</a>  <div class="tooltip-content" style="display: none"> Available from: Michel Valstar </div> </div>   </div>  </div>  <div class="indent-right">      </div>  <ul class="citation-contexts" id="rgw45_56ab1f1f44a70">  <li class="citation-context-item"> "Recently, deep learning algorithms have shown significant performance improvements for object detection tasks [13] [7].

It depends on multiple factors including shape, appearance and dynamics of the facial features, all of which are adversely affected by environmental noise and low intensity signals typical of such conditions. In this work, we present a novel approach to Facial Action Unit detection using a combination of Convolutional and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNN-BLSTM), which jointly learns shape, appearance and dynamics in a deep learning manner. In addition, we introduce a novel way to encode shape features using binary image masks computed from the locations of facial landmarks. We show that the combination of dynamic CNN features and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory excels at modelling the temporal information. We thoroughly evaluate the contributions of each component in our system and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FERA-2015 Challenge dataset. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">   <span class="ico-publication-fulltext reset-background"></span> Full-text   &middot; Conference Paper &middot; Mar 2016  </div>        <div class="publication-actions"> <div class="btn-group">  <a class="btn btn-plain action-download primary  open-viewer" href="profile/Michel_Valstar/publication/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units/links/569fb2ab08ae4af52546c3da.pdf?origin=publication_list">  <span class="js-btn-label">Download</span> </a>    </div> </div>      </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication   includes-citation-list"  id="rgw46_56ab1f1f44a70" >  <div class="indent-left">  <div id="rgw47_56ab1f1f44a70" class="js-publication-item-fulltext fulltext-thumb">    <a class="publication-preview ga-publication-viewer js-publication-item-fulltext-content" href="publication/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch">       </a>   <div class="preview-source-info"> <a class="details js-show-source ga-source-url" href="profile/Marc_Chaumont" >Source</a>  <div class="tooltip-content" style="display: none"> Available from: Marc Chaumont </div> </div>   </div>  </div>  <div class="indent-right">      </div>  <ul class="citation-contexts" id="rgw48_56ab1f1f44a70">  <li class="citation-context-item"> "In this paper, we recall the major concepts of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which is a deep learning network that has proved its efficiency in image classification competitions [13], and that was used by Qian et al. for steganalysis purposes.

In 2015, Qian et al. have shown that the use of a deep learning approach that jointly learns and computes the features, was very promising for the steganalysis.

In this paper, we follow-up the study of Qian et al., and show that in the scenario where the steganograph always uses the same embedding key for embedding with the simulator in the different images, due to intrinsic joint minimization and the preservation of spatial information, the results obtained from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN), if well parameterized, surpass the conventional use of a RM with an EC.

First, numerous experiments were conducted in order to find the best ”shape” of the CNN. Second, experiments were carried out in the clairvoyant scenario in order to compare the CNN and FNN to an RM with an EC. The results show more than 16% reduction in the classification error with our CNN or FNN. Third, experiments were also performed in a cover-source mismatch setting. The results show that the CNN and FNN are naturally robust to the mismatch problem.

In Addition to the experiments, we provide discussions on the internal mechanisms of a CNN, and weave links with some previously stated ideas, in order to understand the results we obtained. We also have a discussion on the scenario ”same embedding key”. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">   <span class="ico-publication-fulltext reset-background"></span> Full-text   &middot; Conference Paper &middot; Feb 2016  </div>        <div class="publication-actions"> <div class="btn-group">  <a class="btn btn-plain action-download primary  open-viewer" href="profile/Marc_Chaumont/publication/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch/links/5644855f08ae9f9c13e51d31.pdf?origin=publication_list">  <span class="js-btn-label">Download</span> </a>    </div> </div>      </li>  </ul>    <a class="show-more-rebranded js-show-more rf text-gray-lighter">Show more</a> <span class="ajax-loading-small list-loading" style="display: none"></span>  <div class="clearfix"></div>  <div class="publication-detail-sidebar-legal">Note: This list is based on the publications in our database and might not be exhaustive.</div> <div class="clearfix"></div>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="clearfix">     <div id="rgw27_56ab1f1f44a70" class="c-box pub-resource-container js-toggle" style="display: none;"> <h4 class="lf js-expand-list"><small><a href="javascript:" class="lf">View other sources <span class="ico-expand-list"></span></a></small></h4> <h4 class="lf js-collapse-list hidden"><small><a href="javascript:" class="lf">Hide other sources <span class="ico-collapse-list"></span></a></small></h4> <div class="clear"></div> <div class="scroll-wrapper hidden"> <ul class="files-list c-list" id="rgw28_56ab1f1f44a70">  </ul> </div> </div>  <div id="rgw32_56ab1f1f44a70" class="questions-container"> <h2>Questions & Answers about this publication</h2> <ul class="c-list post-list">  <li id="rgw33_56ab1f1f44a70" class="c-list-item topics-post-feed-item ">   <div class="topics-post-feed-item-reason"><a href="profile/Alexey_Egorov5" class="js-reason-profile">Alexey Egorov</a> added an answer in <a href="topic/artificial_neural_networks">Artificial Neural Networks</a>:</div>   <a class="js-question-title topics-post-feed-item-title" href="post/How_do_artificial_neural_network_plays_a_role_in_image_processing">How do artificial neural network plays a role in image processing?</a> <div class="topics-post-feed-item-text expandable-body rich-text-unstyled topics-post-feed-item-has-comment"> <div class="expander-container js-expander-container js-expander-collapsed"> <p>I need some expert suggestion as I am planning to start new work in the field of Artificial Neural Network.

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called &quot;dropout&quot; that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry. </span> </div>    <div class="publication-meta publication-meta">  <span class="ico-publication-preview reset-background"></span> Preview    &middot; Article &middot; Jan 2012  &middot; Advances in neural information processing systems  </div>           </li>    </ul>   </div> </div>  </div>    <div class="topics-post-feed-item-actions">  <div class="topics-post-feed-item-actions-followconfirm lf action-confirm details" style="display: none;"><span class="topics-post-feed-item-actions-followconfirm-ico ico-confirm"></span> Following </div>   <div class="lf topics-post-feed-item-info details"> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div>  <div class="clear"></div> </li>  </ul>  </div> <div id="rgw19_56ab1f1f44a70" class="similar-publications"> <h2>Similar Publications</h2> <ul class="list-bordered">  <li class="c-list-item li-publication-teaser" id="rgw20_56ab1f1f44a70"> <div> <h5> <a href="publication/285548706_State_of_Neural_Networks_Is_Strong" class="color-inherit ga-similar-publication-title"><span class="publication-title">State of Neural Networks Is Strong</span></a>  </h5>  <div class="authors"> <a href="researcher/2066277764_Kenji_Doya" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Kenji Doya</a>, <a href="researcher/2066274529_DeLiang_Wang" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">DeLiang Wang</a>  </div>  </div> <div class="clear"></div> </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication-teaser" id="rgw21_56ab1f1f44a70"> <div> <h5> <a href="publication/290508995_Conference_Report_on_2015_International_Joint_Conference_on_Neural_Networks_IJCNN_2015_Conference_Reports" class="color-inherit ga-similar-publication-title"><span class="publication-title">Conference Report on 2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2015) [Conference Reports]</span></a>  </h5>  <div class="authors"> <a href="researcher/2094137385_Yoonsuck_Choe" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Yoonsuck Choe</a>, <a href="researcher/2094085099_Asim_Roy" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Asim Roy</a>, <a href="researcher/2094019427_Haibo_He" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Haibo He</a>, <a href="researcher/2094076580_De-Shuang_Huang" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">De-Shuang Huang</a>  </div>  </div> <div class="clear"></div> </li>  <li class="c-list-item li-publication-teaser" id="rgw22_56ab1f1f44a70"> <div> <h5> <a href="publication/291366272_Risk_analysis_in_maintainability_of_high-rise_buildings_under_tropical_conditions_using_ensemble_neural_network" class="color-inherit ga-similar-publication-title"><span class="publication-title">Risk analysis in maintainability of high-rise buildings under tropical conditions using ensemble neural network</span></a>  </h5>  <div class="authors"> <a href="researcher/2005929635_Nayanthara_De_Silva" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Nayanthara De Silva</a>, <a href="researcher/2095370966_Malik_Ranasinghe" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Malik Ranasinghe</a>, <a href="researcher/2095273496_Chathura_Ranjan_De_Silva" class="authors ga-similar-publication-author">Chathura Ranjan De Silva</a>  </div>  </div> <div class="clear"></div> </li>  </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div></div>

trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif-ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called &quot;dropout&quot; that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.<\/div>","canEdit":false,"isAdmin":false,"isArtifact":false,"showFullAbstract":false,"widgetId":"rgw18_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw18_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationAbstract.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":[],"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationAbstract.html?publicationUid=267960550","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationAbstractView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationAbstractView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"publicationKeywords":null,"publicationState":null,"isGuest":true,"isAdminEditingAllowed":false,"isArtifact":false,"figureListWidget":null,"previewImage":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks\/links\/54b511970cf2318f0f97189b\/smallpreview.png","nativeAdDisclosure":null,"showFollowPublicationButton":false,"followPublicationPromo":"","widgetId":"rgw8_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw8_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationDetailItem.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationDetailItem.html?publicationUid=267960550&showActionBar=0&showContactAuthorButton=1&showRequestFulltextExperience=0&showNoRgAuthorsRequestFulltextExperience=0&showFollowPublicationPromo=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationDetailItemView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationDetailItemView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"similarPublications":{"data":{"publicationListItems":[{"data":{"milestones":{"moreContext":"experimentMilestoneClickedCitationContextReadMore","clickThrough":"experimentMilestoneClickedToPublicationFromReferenceWithNoFulltext","clickThroughWithContext":"experimentMilestoneClickedCitationContextReadMore"},"nextPublicationMilestone":"experimentMilestoneRequestFulltextNoPreview","nextPublicationViewId":null,"authorsPartOne":[{"id":2066277764,"url":"researcher\/2066277764_Kenji_Doya","fullname":"Kenji

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5%\nand 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The\nneural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists\nof five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,\nand three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-\ning faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-\ntation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected\nlayers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called \u201cdropout\u201d\nthat proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the\nILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,\ncompared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.\n1 Introduction\nCurrent approaches to object recognition make essential use of machine learning methods. To im-\nprove their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use bet-\nter techniques for preventing overfitting. Until recently, datasets of labeled images were relatively\nsmall \u2014 on the order of tens of thousands of images (e.g., NORB [16], Caltech-101\/256 [8, 9], and\nCIFAR-10\/100 [12]). Simple recognition tasks can be solved quite well with datasets of this size,\nespecially if they are augmented with label-preserving transformations. For example, the current-\nbest error rate on the MNIST digit-recognition task (<0.3%) approaches human performance [4].\nBut objects in realistic settings exhibit considerable variability, so to learn to recognize them it is\nnecessary to use much larger training sets. And indeed, the shortcomings of small image datasets\nhave been widely recognized (e.g., Pinto et al. [21]), but it has only recently become possible to col-\nlect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which\nconsists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of\nover 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories.\nTo learn about thousands of objects from millions of images, we need a model with a large learning\ncapacity. However, the immense complexity of the object recognition task means that this prob-\nlem cannot be specified even by a dataset as large as ImageNet, so our model should also have lots\nof prior knowledge to compensate for all the data we don\u2019t have. Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) constitute one such class of models [16, 11, 13, 18, 15, 22, 26]. Their capacity can be con-\ntrolled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions\nabout the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies).\nThus, compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers, CNNs have\nmuch fewer connections and parameters and so they are easier to train, while their theoretically-best\nperformance is likely to be only slightly worse.\n1"},{"page":2,"text":"Despite the attractive qualities of CNNs, and despite the relative efficiency of their local architecture,\nthey have still been prohibitively expensive to apply in large scale to high-resolution images. Luck-\nily, current GPUs, paired with a highly-optimized implementation of 2D convolution, are powerful\nenough to facilitate the training of interestingly-large CNNs, and recent datasets such as ImageNet\ncontain enough labeled examples to train such models without severe overfitting.\nThe specific contributions of this paper are as follows: we trained one of the largest convolutional\nneural networks to date on the subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012\ncompetitions [2] and achieved by far the best results ever reported on these datasets. We wrote a\nhighly-optimized GPU implementation of 2D convolution and all the other operations inherent in\ntraining convolutional neural networks, which we make available publicly1. Our network contains\na number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time,\nwhich are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even\nwith 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing\noverfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and\nthree fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any\nconvolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model\u2019s parameters) resulted in\ninferior performance.\nIn the end, the network\u2019s size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs\nand by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five\nand six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results\ncan be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.\n2 The Dataset\nImageNet is a dataset of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000\ncategories. The images were collected from the web and labeled by human labelers using Ama-\nzon\u2019s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool. Starting in 2010, as part of the Pascal Visual Object\nChallenge, an annual competition called the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge\n(ILSVRC) has been held. ILSVRC uses a subset of ImageNet with roughly 1000 images in each of\n1000 categories. In all, there are roughly 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and\n150,000 testing images.\nILSVRC-2010 is the only version of ILSVRC for which the test set labels are available, so this is\nthe version on which we performed most of our experiments. Since we also entered our model in\nthe ILSVRC-2012 competition, in Section 6 we report our results on this version of the dataset as\nwell, for which test set labels are unavailable. On ImageNet, it is customary to report two error rates:\ntop-1 and top-5, where the top-5 error rate is the fraction of test images for which the correct label\nis not among the five labels considered most probable by the model.\nImageNet consists of variable-resolution images, while our system requires a constant input dimen-\nsionality. Therefore, we down-sampled the images to a fixed resolution of 256 \u00d7 256. Given a\nrectangular image, we first rescaled the image such that the shorter side was of length 256, and then\ncropped out the central 256\u00d7256 patch from the resulting image. We did not pre-process the images\nin any other way, except for subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. So\nwe trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels.\n3 The Architecture\nThe architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers \u2014\nfive convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual\nfeatures of our network\u2019s architecture. Sections 3.1-3.4 are sorted according to our estimation of\ntheir importance, with the most important first.\n1http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/cuda-convnet\/\n2"},{"page":3,"text":"3.1ReLU Nonlinearity\nFigure 1: A four-layer convolutional neural\nnetwork with ReLUs (solid line) reaches a 25%\ntraining error rate on CIFAR-10 six times faster\nthan an equivalent network with tanh neurons\n(dashed line). The learning rates for each net-\nwork were chosen independently to make train-\ning as fast as possible. No regularization of\nany kind was employed. The magnitude of the\neffect demonstrated here varies with network\narchitecture, but networks with ReLUs consis-\ntently learn several times faster than equivalents\nwith saturating neurons.\nThe standard way to model a neuron\u2019s output f as\na function of its input x is with f(x) = tanh(x)\nor f(x) = (1 + e\u2212x)\u22121. In terms of training time\nwith gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities\nare much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity\nf(x) = max(0,x). Following Nair and Hinton [20],\nwe refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified\nLinear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural net-\nworks with ReLUs train several times faster than their\nequivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in\nFigure 1, which shows the number of iterations re-\nquired to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10\ndataset for a particular four-layer convolutional net-\nwork. This plot shows that we would not have been\nable to experiment with such large neural networks for\nthis work if we had used traditional saturating neuron\nmodels.\nWe are not the first to consider alternatives to tradi-\ntional neuron models in CNNs. For example, Jarrett\netal.[11]claimthatthenonlinearityf(x) = |tanh(x)|\nworks particularly well with their type of contrast nor-\nmalization followed by local average pooling on the\nCaltech-101 dataset. However, on this dataset the pri-\nmary concern is preventing overfitting, so the effect\nthey are observing is different from the accelerated\nability to fit the training set which we report when us-\ning ReLUs. Faster learning has a great influence on the\nperformance of large models trained on large datasets.\n3.2Training on Multiple GPUs\nA single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks\nthat can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks\nwhich are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs\nare particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to\none another\u2019s memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization\nscheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one\nadditional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the\nkernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input\nonly from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of\nconnectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of\ncommunication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation.\nThe resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the \u201ccolumnar\u201d CNN employed by Cire\u00b8 san\net al. [5], except that our columns are not independent (see Figure 2). This scheme reduces our top-1\nand top-5 error rates by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively, as compared with a net with half as many\nkernels in each convolutional layer trained on one GPU. The two-GPU net takes slightly less time\nto train than the one-GPU net2.\n2The one-GPU net actually has the same number of kernels as the two-GPU net in the final convolutional\nlayer. This is because most of the net\u2019s parameters are in the first fully-connected layer, which takes the last\nconvolutional layer as input. So to make the two nets have approximately the same number of parameters, we\ndid not halve the size of the final convolutional layer (nor the fully-conneced layers which follow). Therefore\nthis comparison is biased in favor of the one-GPU net, since it is bigger than \u201chalf the size\u201d of the two-GPU\nnet.\n3"},{"page":4,"text":"3.3 Local Response Normalization\nReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them\nfrom saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will\nhappen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids\ngeneralization. Denoting by ai\n(x,y) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity bi\nthe expression\n\uf8eb\nj=max(0,i\u2212n\/2)\nwhere the sum runs over n \u201cadjacent\u201d kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total\nnumber of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined\nbefore training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition\ninspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron\noutputs computed using different kernels. The constants k,n,\u03b1, and \u03b2 are hyper-parameters whose\nvalues are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2, n = 5, \u03b1 = 10\u22124, and \u03b2 = 0.75. We\napplied this normalization after applying the ReLU nonlinearity in certain layers (see Section 3.5).\nThis scheme bears some resemblance to the local contrast normalization scheme of Jarrett et al. [11],\nbut ours would be more correctly termed \u201cbrightness normalization\u201d, since we do not subtract the\nmean activity. Response normalization reduces our top-1 and top-5 error rates by 1.4% and 1.2%,\nrespectively. We also verified the effectiveness of this scheme on the CIFAR-10 dataset: a four-layer\nCNN achieved a 13% test error rate without normalization and 11% with normalization3.\nx,ythe activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position\nx,yis given by\nbi\nx,y= ai\nx,y\/\n\uf8edk + \u03b1\nmin(N\u22121,i+n\/2)\n?\n(aj\nx,y)2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u03b2\n3.4 Overlapping Pooling\nPooling layers in CNNs summarize the outputs of neighboring groups of neurons in the same kernel\nmap. Traditionally, the neighborhoods summarized by adjacent pooling units do not overlap (e.g.,\n[17, 11, 4]). To be more precise, a pooling layer can be thought of as consisting of a grid of pooling\nunits spaced s pixels apart, each summarizing a neighborhood of size z \u00d7 z centered at the location\nof the pooling unit. If we set s = z, we obtain traditional local pooling as commonly employed\nin CNNs. If we set s < z, we obtain overlapping pooling. This is what we use throughout our\nnetwork, with s = 2 and z = 3. This scheme reduces the top-1 and top-5 error rates by 0.4% and\n0.3%, respectively, as compared with the non-overlapping scheme s = 2,z = 2, which produces\noutput of equivalent dimensions. We generally observe during training that models with overlapping\npooling find it slightly more difficult to overfit.\n3.5Overall Architecture\nNow we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net\ncontains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three are fully-\nconnected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces\na distribution over the 1000 class labels. Our network maximizes the multinomial logistic regression\nobjective, which is equivalent to maximizing the average across training cases of the log-probability\nof the correct label under the prediction distribution.\nThe kernels of the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected only to those kernel\nmaps in the previous layer which reside on the same GPU (see Figure 2). The kernels of the third\nconvolutional layer are connected to all kernel maps in the second layer. The neurons in the fully-\nconnected layers are connected to all neurons in the previous layer. Response-normalization layers\nfollowthefirstandsecondconvolutionallayers. Max-poolinglayers, ofthekinddescribedinSection\n3.4, follow both response-normalization layers as well as the fifth convolutional layer. The ReLU\nnon-linearity is applied to the output of every convolutional and fully-connected layer.\nThe first convolutional layer filters the 224\u00d7224\u00d73 input image with 96 kernels of size 11\u00d711\u00d73\nwith a stride of 4 pixels (this is the distance between the receptive field centers of neighboring\n3We cannot describe this network in detail due to space constraints, but it is specified precisely by the code\nand parameter files provided here: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/cuda-convnet\/.\n4"},{"page":5,"text":"Figure 2: An illustration of the architecture of our CNN, explicitly showing the delineation of responsibilities\nbetween the two GPUs.

The second convolutional layer takes as input the (response-normalized\nand pooled) output of the first convolutional layer and filters it with 256 kernels of size 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 48.\nThe third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected to one another without any intervening\npooling or normalization layers. The third convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7\n256 connected to the (normalized, pooled) outputs of the second convolutional layer.

The fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.\n4 Reducing Overfitting\nOur neural network architecture has 60 million parameters. Although the 1000 classes of ILSVRC\nmake each training example impose 10 bits of constraint on the mapping from image to label, this\nturns out to be insufficient to learn so many parameters without considerable overfitting. Below, we\ndescribe the two primary ways in which we combat overfitting.\n4.1 Data Augmentation\nThe easiest and most common method to reduce overfitting on image data is to artificially enlarge\nthe dataset using label-preserving transformations (e.g., [25, 4, 5]). We employ two distinct forms\nof data augmentation, both of which allow transformed images to be produced from the original\nimages with very little computation, so the transformed images do not need to be stored on disk.\nIn our implementation, the transformed images are generated in Python code on the CPU while the\nGPU is training on the previous batch of images. So these data augmentation schemes are, in effect,\ncomputationally free.\nThe first form of data augmentation consists of generating image translations and horizontal reflec-\ntions. We do this by extracting random 224\u00d7224 patches (and their horizontal reflections) from the\n256\u00d7256 images and training our network on these extracted patches4. This increases the size of our\ntraining set by a factor of 2048, though the resulting training examples are, of course, highly inter-\ndependent. Without this scheme, our network suffers from substantial overfitting, which would have\nforced us to use much smaller networks. At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting\nfive 224 \u00d7 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal\nreflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network\u2019s softmax\nlayer on the ten patches.\nThe second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in\ntraining images. Specifically, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the\nImageNet training set. To each training image, we add multiples of the found principal components,\n4This is the reason why the input images in Figure 2 are 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3-dimensional.\n5"},{"page":6,"text":"with magnitudes proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues times a random variable drawn from\na Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. Therefore to each RGB image pixel Ixy=\n[IR\nxy,IG\nxy,IB\nxy]Twe add the following quantity:\n[p1,p2,p3][\u03b11\u03bb1,\u03b12\u03bb2,\u03b13\u03bb3]T\nwhere piand \u03bbiare ith eigenvector and eigenvalue of the 3 \u00d7 3 covariance matrix of RGB pixel\nvalues, respectively, and \u03b1iis the aforementioned random variable. Each \u03b1iis drawn only once\nfor all the pixels of a particular training image until that image is used for training again, at which\npoint it is re-drawn. This scheme approximately captures an important property of natural images,\nnamely, that object identity is invariant to changes in the intensity and color of the illumination. This\nscheme reduces the top-1 error rate by over 1%.\n4.2Dropout\nCombining the predictions of many different models is a very successful way to reduce test errors\n[1, 3], but it appears to be too expensive for big neural networks that already take several days\nto train. There is, however, a very efficient version of model combination that only costs about a\nfactor of two during training. The recently-introduced technique, called \u201cdropout\u201d [10], consists\nof setting to zero the output of each hidden neuron with probability 0.5. The neurons which are\n\u201cdropped out\u201d in this way do not contribute to the forward pass and do not participate in back-\npropagation. So every time an input is presented, the neural network samples a different architecture,\nbut all these architectures share weights. This technique reduces complex co-adaptations of neurons,\nsince a neuron cannot rely on the presence of particular other neurons. It is, therefore, forced to\nlearn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the\nother neurons. At test time, we use all the neurons but multiply their outputs by 0.5, which is a\nreasonable approximation to taking the geometric mean of the predictive distributions produced by\nthe exponentially-many dropout networks.\nWe use dropout in the first two fully-connected layers of Figure 2. Without dropout, our network ex-\nhibits substantial overfitting. Dropout roughly doubles the number of iterations required to converge.\nFigure 3: 96 convolutional kernels of size\n11\u00d711\u00d73learnedbythefirstconvolutional\nlayeronthe224\u00d7224\u00d73inputimages.

See Section 6.1 for details.\n5 Details of learning\nWe trained our models using stochastic gradient descent\nwith a batch size of 128 examples, momentum of 0.9, and\nweight decay of 0.0005. We found that this small amount\nof weight decay was important for the model to learn. In\nother words, weight decay here is not merely a regularizer:\nit reduces the model\u2019s training error.

We initialized the neuron biases in the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers,\nas well as in the fully-connected hidden layers, with the constant 1. This initialization accelerates\nthe early stages of learning by providing the ReLUs with positive inputs. We initialized the neuron\nbiases in the remaining layers with the constant 0.\nWe used an equal learning rate for all layers, which we adjusted manually throughout training.\nThe heuristic which we followed was to divide the learning rate by 10 when the validation error\nrate stopped improving with the current learning rate.

The\nnetwork has learned a variety of frequency- and orientation-selective kernels, as well as various col-\nored blobs. Notice the specialization exhibited by the two GPUs, a result of the restricted connec-\ntivity described in Section 3.5. The kernels on GPU 1 are largely color-agnostic, while the kernels\non on GPU 2 are largely color-specific. This kind of specialization occurs during every run and is\nindependent of any particular random weight initialization (modulo a renumbering of the GPUs).\n5The error rates without averaging predictions over ten patches as described in Section 4.1 are 39.0% and\n18.3%.\n7"},{"page":8,"text":"Figure 4: (Left) Eight ILSVRC-2010 test images and the five labels considered most probable by our model.\nThe correct label is written under each image, and the probability assigned to the correct label is also shown\nwith a red bar (if it happens to be in the top 5). (Right) Five ILSVRC-2010 test images in the first column. The\nremaining columns show the six training images that produce feature vectors in the last hidden layer with the\nsmallest Euclidean distance from the feature vector for the test image.\nIn the left panel of Figure 4 we qualitatively assess what the network has learned by computing its\ntop-5 predictions on eight test images. Notice that even off-center objects, such as the mite in the\ntop-left, can be recognized by the net. Most of the top-5 labels appear reasonable. For example,\nonly other types of cat are considered plausible labels for the leopard. In some cases (grille, cherry)\nthere is genuine ambiguity about the intended focus of the photograph.\nAnother way to probe the network\u2019s visual knowledge is to consider the feature activations induced\nby an image at the last, 4096-dimensional hidden layer. If two images produce feature activation\nvectors with a small Euclidean separation, we can say that the higher levels of the neural network\nconsider them to be similar. Figure 4 shows five images from the test set and the six images from\nthe training set that are most similar to each of them according to this measure. Notice that at the\npixel level, the retrieved training images are generally not close in L2 to the query images in the first\ncolumn. For example, the retrieved dogs and elephants appear in a variety of poses. We present the\nresults for many more test images in the supplementary material.\nComputing similarity by using Euclidean distance between two 4096-dimensional, real-valued vec-\ntorsisinefficient, butitcouldbemadeefficientbytraininganauto-encodertocompressthesevectors\nto short binary codes. This should produce a much better image retrieval method than applying auto-\nencoders to the raw pixels [14], which does not make use of image labels and hence has a tendency\nto retrieve images with similar patterns of edges, whether or not they are semantically similar.\n7 Discussion\nOur results show that a large, deep convolutional neural network is capable of achieving record-\nbreaking results on a highly challenging dataset using purely supervised learning. It is notable\nthat our network\u2019s performance degrades if a single convolutional layer is removed. For example,\nremoving any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the\nnetwork. So the depth really is important for achieving our results.\nTo simplify our experiments, we did not use any unsupervised pre-training even though we expect\nthat it will help, especially if we obtain enough computational power to significantly increase the\nsize of the network without obtaining a corresponding increase in the amount of labeled data. Thus\nfar, our results have improved as we have made our network larger and trained it longer but we still\nhave many orders of magnitude to go in order to match the infero-temporal pathway of the human\nvisual system. Ultimately we would like to use very large and deep convolutional nets on video\nsequences where the temporal structure provides very helpful information that is missing or far less\nobvious in static images.\n8"},{"page":9,"text":"References\n[1] R.M.BellandY.Koren.

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.","description":false,"swapJournalAndAuthorPositions":false,"showAbstract":true,"type":"Article","showType":true,"showPublicationIcon":false,"showSeeInContextCta":false,"publicationUrlWithContext":"publication\/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","isReader":null,"isAuthor":null,"isRequester":false,"hasFulltext":false,"actions":[],"actionWidgets":[],"publicationItemFulltext":{"data":{"isDataset":false,"isResearch":false,"isFulltext":true,"source":{"isPreview":true,"sourceUrl":"deref\/http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.nips.cc%2Fpapers%2Ffiles%2Fnips25%2FNIPS2012_0534.pdf","sourceName":"books.nips.cc","hasSourceUrl":true},"publicationUid":267960550,"publicationUrl":"publication\/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","eventCode":"","citationCount":0,"additionalContentWidgets":[],"disableViewer":true,"showLoggedOutRequestButton":false,"context":null,"previewUrl":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks\/links\/54b511970cf2318f0f97189b\/smallpreview.png","linkId":"54b511970cf2318f0f97189b","origin":"publication_list","showRequestCount":false,"publish":false,"request":false,"showAction":false,"displayAsLink":true,"documentViewerUrl":"publicliterature.PublicLiteratureDocumentViewer.html?publicationId=267960550&reference=54b511970cf2318f0f97189b&eventCode=&origin=publication_list","widgetId":"rgw37_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw37_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationItemFulltext.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltext.html?publicationUid=267960550&showAction=1&eventCode=&hideSource=0&displayAsLink=1&showPublishAsSelectFile=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"linkId":null,"context":null,"contextId":null,"eventCode":"","isCitation":false,"isPendingCitationRequest":false,"canRemoveCitation":false,"citationSourcePublicationUid":false,"publicationCitationUid":false,"showPublicationDownloadDataUsagePermissionDialog":false,"origin":"publication_list","keywordList":null,"hasKeywordList":false,"showOpenReviewButton":false,"openReviewUrl":"publication\/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks\/review","additionalRightSideTopWidgets":[],"additionalRightSideBottomWidgets":[],"requestEndpointPrimary":"literature.PublicationPromoRequestFulltextAction.html?dbw=true","requestEndpointImage":"literature.PublicationPromoRequestFulltextAction.html?dbw=true","doi":false,"hasMicrodata":false,"microdataPropertyName":null,"showPublicationPreview":true,"showPublicationPreviewOnRightSide":false,"showActionsOnRightSide":false,"swapJournalAndAbstractPositions":false,"displayUpdatedExpanderPlugin":false,"showActions":false,"showAuthors":true,"isResearch":false,"publicationLinkText":"Read preview","widgetId":"rgw36_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw36_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":{"publicationItem":"publicliterature\/stubs\/partials\/publicationItem.html"},"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationItem.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"opensViewer":true,"requestFulltextInvitationDialogUrl":"literature.PublicationRequestFulltextInvitationDialog.html","followContext":"publication_item","publicationBookmarkEndpointUrl":"literature.AjaxFollowPublication.html","preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationItem.html?publicationUid=267960550","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationItemView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationItemView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true}}],"hasLinks":false,"hasFiles":false,"hasPublications":true,"hasImages":false,"hasMoreAttachments":false,"amountMoreAttachments":0,"widgetId":"rgw35_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw35_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":[],"templateName":"publictopics\/stubs\/TopicPostAttachmentsList.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":[],"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publictopics.TopicPostAttachmentsList.html?limit=1","viewClass":"views.publictopics.TopicPostAttachmentsListView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publictopics.TopicPostAttachmentsListView","css-modules-publictopics"],"stylesheets":["modules\/publictopics.css"],"_isYUI":true},"postId":"563129cc5f7f71cb818b457b","type":"comment","title":"Dear Dheeman,At first -

AAAI Fall Symposium Series on Human-Robot Interaction; 11\/2016"],"abstract":"Recent progress in machine learning has lead to great advancements in robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI). It is reported that robots can deeply understand visual scene information and describe the scenes in natural language using object recognition and natural language processing methods. Image-based question and answering (Q&A) systems can be used for enhancing HRI. However, despite these successful results, several key issues still remain to be discussed and improved. In particular, it is essential for an agent to act in a dynamic, uncertain, and asynchronous environment for achieving human-level robot intelligence. In this paper, we propose a prototype system for a video Q&A robot \" Pororobot \". The system uses the state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as a deep concept hierarchy model. In our scenario, a robot and a child plays a video Q&A game together under real world environments.

It depends on multiple factors including shape, appearance and dynamics of the facial features, all of which are adversely affected by environmental noise and low intensity signals typical of such conditions. In this work, we present a novel approach to Facial Action Unit detection using a combination of Convolutional and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNN-BLSTM), which jointly learns shape, appearance and dynamics in a deep learning manner. In addition, we introduce a novel way to encode shape features using binary image masks computed from the locations of facial landmarks. We show that the combination of dynamic CNN features and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory excels at modelling the temporal information. We thoroughly evaluate the contributions of each component in our system and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FERA-2015 Challenge dataset.","description":false,"swapJournalAndAuthorPositions":false,"showAbstract":true,"type":"Conference Paper","showType":true,"showPublicationIcon":false,"showSeeInContextCta":false,"publicationUrlWithContext":"publication\/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units","isReader":null,"isAuthor":null,"isRequester":false,"hasFulltext":true,"actions":[{"type":"download","text":"Download","url":"profile\/Michel_Valstar\/publication\/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units\/links\/569fb2ab08ae4af52546c3da.pdf?origin=publication_list","active":false,"primary":true,"extraClass":"open-viewer","icon":null,"data":[]}],"actionWidgets":[],"publicationItemFulltext":{"data":{"isDataset":false,"isResearch":false,"isFulltext":true,"source":{"isPreview":false,"sourceUrl":"profile\/Michel_Valstar","sourceName":"Michel Valstar","hasSourceUrl":true},"publicationUid":291331681,"publicationUrl":"publication\/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units","eventCode":"","citationCount":0,"additionalContentWidgets":[],"disableViewer":true,"showLoggedOutRequestButton":false,"context":null,"previewUrl":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units\/links\/569fb2ab08ae4af52546c3da\/smallpreview.png","linkId":"569fb2ab08ae4af52546c3da","origin":"publication_list","showRequestCount":false,"publish":false,"request":false,"showAction":false,"displayAsLink":true,"documentViewerUrl":"publicliterature.PublicLiteratureDocumentViewer.html?publicationId=291331681&reference=569fb2ab08ae4af52546c3da&eventCode=&origin=publication_list","widgetId":"rgw44_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw44_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationItemFulltext.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltext.html?publicationUid=291331681&showAction=1&eventCode=&hideSource=0&displayAsLink=1&showPublishAsSelectFile=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"linkId":"569fb2ab08ae4af52546c3da","context":null,"contextId":null,"eventCode":"","isCitation":true,"isPendingCitationRequest":false,"canRemoveCitation":false,"citationSourcePublicationUid":267960550,"publicationCitationUid":false,"showPublicationDownloadDataUsagePermissionDialog":false,"origin":"publication_list","keywordList":null,"hasKeywordList":false,"showOpenReviewButton":false,"openReviewUrl":"publication\/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units\/review","additionalRightSideTopWidgets":[{"data":{"citationContexts":["Recently, deep learning algorithms have shown significant performance improvements for object detection tasks [13] [7].

most steganalysis approaches use a learning methodology involving two steps: feature extraction, such as the Rich Models (RM), for the image representation, and use of the Ensemble Classifier (EC) for the learning step. In 2015, Qian et al. have shown that the use of a deep learning approach that jointly learns and computes the features, was very promising for the steganalysis.\n\nIn this paper, we follow-up the study of Qian et al., and show that in the scenario where the steganograph always uses the same embedding key for embedding with the simulator in the different images, due to intrinsic joint minimization and the preservation of spatial information, the results obtained from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN), if well parameterized, surpass the conventional use of a RM with an EC.\n\nFirst, numerous experiments were conducted in order to find the best \u201dshape\u201d of the CNN. Second, experiments were carried out in the clairvoyant scenario in order to compare the CNN and FNN to an RM with an EC. The results show more than 16% reduction in the classification error with our CNN or FNN. Third, experiments were also performed in a cover-source mismatch setting. The results show that the CNN and FNN are naturally robust to the mismatch problem.\n\nIn Addition to the experiments, we provide discussions on the internal mechanisms of a CNN, and weave links with some previously stated ideas, in order to understand the results we obtained. We also have a discussion on the scenario \u201dsame embedding key\u201d.","description":false,"swapJournalAndAuthorPositions":false,"showAbstract":true,"type":"Conference Paper","showType":true,"showPublicationIcon":false,"showSeeInContextCta":false,"publicationUrlWithContext":"publication\/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch","isReader":null,"isAuthor":null,"isRequester":false,"hasFulltext":true,"actions":[{"type":"download","text":"Download","url":"profile\/Marc_Chaumont\/publication\/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch\/links\/5644855f08ae9f9c13e51d31.pdf?origin=publication_list","active":false,"primary":true,"extraClass":"open-viewer","icon":null,"data":[]}],"actionWidgets":[],"publicationItemFulltext":{"data":{"isDataset":false,"isResearch":false,"isFulltext":true,"source":{"isPreview":false,"sourceUrl":"profile\/Marc_Chaumont","sourceName":"Marc Chaumont","hasSourceUrl":true},"publicationUid":283716595,"publicationUrl":"publication\/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch","eventCode":"","citationCount":0,"additionalContentWidgets":[],"disableViewer":true,"showLoggedOutRequestButton":false,"context":null,"previewUrl":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch\/links\/5644855f08ae9f9c13e51d31\/smallpreview.png","linkId":"5644855f08ae9f9c13e51d31","origin":"publication_list","showRequestCount":false,"publish":false,"request":false,"showAction":false,"displayAsLink":true,"documentViewerUrl":"publicliterature.PublicLiteratureDocumentViewer.html?publicationId=283716595&reference=5644855f08ae9f9c13e51d31&eventCode=&origin=publication_list","widgetId":"rgw47_56ab1f1f44a70"},"id":"rgw47_56ab1f1f44a70","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationItemFulltext.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltext.html?publicationUid=283716595&showAction=1&eventCode=&hideSource=0&displayAsLink=1&showPublishAsSelectFile=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationItemFulltextView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"linkId":"5644855f08ae9f9c13e51d31","context":null,"contextId":null,"eventCode":"","isCitation":true,"isPendingCitationRequest":false,"canRemoveCitation":false,"citationSourcePublicationUid":267960550,"publicationCitationUid":false,"showPublicationDownloadDataUsagePermissionDialog":false,"origin":"publication_list","keywordList":null,"hasKeywordList":false,"showOpenReviewButton":false,"openReviewUrl":"publication\/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch\/review","additionalRightSideTopWidgets":[{"data":{"citationContexts":["In this paper, we recall the major concepts of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which is a deep learning network that has proved its efficiency in image classification competitions [13], and that was used by Qian et al. for steganalysis purposes.
