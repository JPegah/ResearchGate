The primary reason for this is their ability to find<br />multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in one single simulation run.<br />Since evolutionary algorithms (EAs) work with a population of<br />solutions, a simple EA can be extended to maintain a diverse<br />set of solutions. With an emphasis for moving toward the true<br />Pareto-optimal region, an EA can be used to find multiple<br />Pareto-optimal solutions in one single simulation run.<br />The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) pro-<br />posed in [20] was one of the first such EAs. Over the years, the<br />main criticisms of the NSGA approach have been as follows.<br />1) Highcomputationalcomplexityofnondominatedsorting:<br />Thecurrently-used nondominatedsorting algorithm hasa<br />computational complexity of<br />number of objectives and<br />makes NSGA computationally expensive for large popu-<br />lation sizes. This large complexity arises because of the<br />complexity involved in the nondominated sorting proce-<br />dure in every generation.<br />2) Lackofelitism:Recentresults[25],[18]showthatelitism<br />can speed up the performance of the GA significantly,<br />which also can help preventing the loss of good solutions<br />once they are found.<br />3) Need for specifying the sharing parameter<br />tionalmechanismsofensuringdiversityinapopulationso<br />as to get a wide variety of equivalent solutions have relied<br />mostly on the concept of sharing. The main problem with<br />sharing is that it requires the specification of a sharing<br />parameter (<br />). Though there has been some work on<br />dynamic sizing of the sharing parameter [10], a param-<br />eter-less diversity-preservation mechanism is desirable.<br />In this paper, we address all of these issues and propose an<br />improved version of NSGA, which we call NSGA-II. From the<br />simulationresultsonanumberofdifficulttestproblems,wefind<br />that NSGA-II outperforms two other contemporary MOEAs:<br />Pareto-archived evolution strategy (PAES) [14] and strength-<br />Pareto EA (SPEA) [24] in terms of finding a diverse set of so-<br />lutions and in converging near the true Pareto-optimal set.<br />Constrainedmultiobjectiveoptimizationisimportantfromthe<br />pointofviewofpracticalproblemsolving,butnotmuchattention<br />has been paid so far in this respect among the EA researchers.<br />In this paper, we suggest a simple constraint-handling strategy<br />with NSGA-II that suits well for any EA. On four problems<br />chosen from the literature, NSGA-II has been compared with<br />another recently suggested constraint-handling strategy.

Finally, we outline the conclusions of this paper.<br />II. ELITIST MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS<br />During 1993–1995, a number of different EAs were sug-<br />gested to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Of them,<br />Fonseca and Fleming’s MOGA [7], Srinivas and Deb’s NSGA<br />[20], and Horn et al.’s NPGA [13] enjoyed more attention.<br />These algorithms demonstrated the necessary additional oper-<br />ators for converting a simple EA to a MOEA. Two common<br />features on all three operators were the following: i) assigning<br />fitness to population members based on nondominated sorting<br />and ii) preserving diversity among solutions of the same<br />nondominated front. Although they have been shown to find<br />multiple nondominated solutions on many test problems and a<br />number of engineering design problems, researchers realized<br />the need of introducing more useful operators (which have<br />been found useful in single-objective EA’s) so as to solve<br />multiobjective optimization problems better. Particularly,<br />the interest has been to introduce elitism to enhance the<br />convergence properties of a MOEA. Reference [25] showed<br />that elitism helps in achieving better convergence in MOEAs.<br />Among the existing elitist MOEAs, Zitzler and Thiele’s SPEA<br />[26], Knowles and Corne’s Pareto-archived PAES [14], and<br />Rudolph’s elitist GA [18] are well studied. We describe these<br />approaches in brief. For details, readers are encouraged to refer<br />to the original studies.<br />Zitzler and Thiele [26] suggested an elitist multicriterion EA<br />with the concept of nondomination in their SPEA. They sug-<br />gested maintaining an external population at every generation<br />storing all nondominated solutions discovered so far beginning<br />from the initial population. This external population partici-<br />pates in all genetic operations. At each generation, a combined<br />population with the external and the current population is first<br />constructed. All nondominated solutions in the combined pop-<br />ulation are assigned a fitness based on the number of solutions<br />they dominate and dominated solutions are assigned fitness<br />worse than the worst fitness of any nondominated solution.<br />This assignment of fitness makes sure that the search is directed<br />toward the nondominated solutions. A deterministic clustering<br />technique is used to ensure diversity among nondominated<br />solutions. Although the implementation suggested in [26] is<br />, with proper bookkeeping the complexity of SPEA<br />can be reduced to<br />.<br />Knowles and Corne [14] suggested a simple MOEA using<br />a single-parent single-offspring EA similar to (1 1)-evolution<br />strategy. Instead of using real parameters, binary strings were<br />used and bitwise mutations were employed to create offsprings.<br />In their PAES, with one parent and one offspring, the offspring<br />is compared with respect to the parent. If the offspring domi-<br />nates the parent, the offspring is accepted as the next parent and<br />the iteration continues. On the other hand, if the parent dom-<br />inates the offspring, the offspring is discarded and a new mu-<br />tated solution (a new offspring) is found. However, if the off-<br />spring and the parent do not dominate each other, the choice be-<br />tween the offspring and the parent is made by comparing them<br />with an archive of best solutions found so far. The offspring is<br />compared with the archive to check if it dominates any member<br />of the archive. If it does, the offspring is accepted as the new<br />parent and all the dominated solutions are eliminated from the<br />archive. If the offspring does not dominate any member of the<br />archive, both parent and offspring are checked for their near-<br />ness with the solutions of the archive. If the offspring resides in<br />a least crowded region in the objective space among the mem-<br />bers ofthearchive,it is acceptedas a parentanda copy of added<br />to the archive. Crowding is maintained by dividing the entire<br />search space deterministically in<br />depth parameter and<br />is the number of decision variables, and<br />by updating the subspaces dynamically. Investigators have cal-<br />culated the worst case complexity of PAES for<br />as<br />, where is the archive length. Since the archive<br />size is usually chosen proportional to the population size<br />overall complexity of the algorithm is<br />Rudolph [18] suggested, but did not simulate, a simple elitist<br />MOEA based on a systematic comparison of individuals from<br />parent and offspring populations. The nondominated solutions<br />of the offspring population are compared with that of parent so-<br />lutions to form an overall nondominated set of solutions, which<br />becomes the parent population of the next iteration. If the size<br />of this set is not greater than the desired population size, other<br />individuals from the offspring population are included. With<br />this strategy, he proved the convergence of this algorithm to the<br />Pareto-optimalfront.Althoughthisisanimportantachievement<br />in its own right, the algorithm lacks motivation for the second<br />taskofmaintainingdiversityofPareto-optimalsolutions.Anex-<br />plicit diversity-preserving mechanism must be added to make it<br />more practical. Since the determinism of the first nondominated<br />front is<br />, the overall complexity of Rudolph’s algo-<br />rithm is also<br />.<br />In the following, we present the proposed nondominated<br />sorting GA approach, which uses a fast nondominated sorting<br />procedure, an elitist-preserving approach, and a parameterless<br />niching operator.<br />subspaces, where is the<br />evaluations<br />, the<br />.<br />III. ELITIST NONDOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM<br />A. Fast Nondominated Sorting Approach<br />For the sake of clarity, we first describe a naive and slow<br />procedure of sorting a population into different nondomination<br />levels.

In the worst case, the task<br />of finding the second front also requires<br />tions, particularly when<br />the second and higher nondominated levels. This argument is<br />true for finding third and higher levels of nondomination. Thus,<br />the worst case is when there are<br />one solution in each front. This requires an overall<br />computations. Note that<br />cedure. In the following paragraph and equation shown at the<br />bottom of the page, we describe a fast nondominated sorting<br />approach which will require<br />First, for each solution we calculate two entities: 1) domi-<br />nation count<br />, the number of solutions which dominate the<br />solution , and 2)<br />, a set of solutions that the solution<br />inates.

Diversity Preservation<br />We mentioned earlier that, along with convergence to the<br />Pareto-optimalset,itisalsodesiredthatanEAmaintainsagood<br />spread of solutions in the obtained set of solutions. The original<br />NSGA used the well-known sharing function approach, which<br />has been found to maintain sustainable diversity in a popula-<br />tion with appropriate setting of its associated parameters. The<br />sharing function method involves a sharing parameter<br />which sets the extent of sharing desired in a problem. This pa-<br />rameter is related to the distance metric chosen to calculate the<br />proximity measure between two population members. The pa-<br />rameter<br />denotes the largest value of that distance metric<br />within which any two solutions share each other’s fitness. This<br />parameter is usually set by the user, although there exist some<br />guidelines [4]. There are two difficulties with this sharing func-<br />tion approach.<br />1) The performance of the sharing function method in<br />maintaining a spread of solutions depends largely on the<br />chosen<br />value.<br />,<br />---<br />for each<br />for each<br />if thenIf<br />Add<br />dominates<br />to the set of solutions dominated by<br />else ifthen<br />Increment the domination counter of<br />belongs to the first frontif then<br />Initialize the front counter<br />while<br />Used to store the members of the next front<br />for each<br />for each<br />if then belongs to the next front</p>  <p>Page 4</p> <p>DEB et al.: A FAST AND ELITIST MULTIOBJECTIVE GA: NSGA-II185<br />Fig. 1.<br />solutions of the same nondominated front.<br />Crowding-distance calculation. Points marked in filled circles are<br />2) Since each solution must be compared with all other so-<br />lutions in the population, the overall complexity of the<br />sharing function approach is<br />In the proposed NSGA-II, we replace the sharing function<br />approach with a crowded-comparison approach that eliminates<br />both the above difficulties to some extent. The new approach<br />does not require any user-defined parameter for maintaining<br />diversity among population members. Also, the suggested ap-<br />proach has a better computational complexity. To describe this<br />approach, we first define a density-estimation metric and then<br />present the crowded-comparison operator.<br />1) Density Estimation: To get an estimate of the density of<br />solutionssurroundinga particularsolutioninthepopulation,we<br />calculate the average distance of two points on either side of<br />this point along each of the objectives. This quantity<br />serves as an estimate of the perimeter of the cuboid formed by<br />usingthenearestneighborsasthevertices(callthisthecrowding<br />distance). In Fig. 1, the crowding distance of the th solution in<br />its front (marked with solid circles) is the average side length of<br />the cuboid (shown with a dashed box).<br />The crowding-distance computation requires sorting the pop-<br />ulation according to each objective function value in ascending<br />order of magnitude. Thereafter, for each objective function, the<br />boundarysolutions (solutionswithsmallestand largestfunction<br />values) are assigned an infinite distance value. All other inter-<br />mediate solutions are assigned a distance value equal to the ab-<br />solute normalized difference in the function values of two adja-<br />centsolutions.Thiscalculationiscontinuedwithotherobjective<br />functions. The overall crowding-distance value is calculated as<br />the sum of individual distance values corresponding to each ob-<br />jective.Eachobjectivefunctionisnormalizedbeforecalculating<br />the crowding distance.

A solution with a smaller<br />value of this distance measure is, in some sense, more crowded<br />by other solutions. This is exactly what we compare in the<br />proposed crowded-comparison operator, described below.<br />Although Fig. 1 illustrates the crowding-distance computation<br />for two objectives, the procedure is applicable to more than two<br />objectives as well.<br />2) Crowded-Comparison Operator: The crowded-compar-<br />ison operator (<br />) guides the selection process at the various<br />stages of the algorithm toward a uniformly spread-out Pareto-<br />optimal front. Assume that every individual in the population<br />has two attributes:<br />1) nondomination rank (<br />2) crowding distance (<br />We now define a partial order<br />refers to the th objective function value of the<br />and the parametersand are<br />th objective func-<br />solu-<br />) are in-<br />computational<br />are assigned a<br />);<br />).<br />as<br />if<br />or<br />and<br />That is, between two solutions with differing nondomination<br />ranks,we preferthesolutionwiththelower(better)rank.Other-<br />wise, if both solutions belong to the same front, then we prefer<br />the solution that is located in a lesser crowded region.<br />With these three new innovations—a fast nondominated<br />sorting procedure, a fast crowded distance estimation proce-<br />dure, and a simple crowded comparison operator, we are now<br />ready to describe the NSGA-II algorithm.<br />C. Main Loop<br />Initially, a random parent population<br />ulation is sorted based on the nondomination. Each solution is<br />assigned a fitness (or rank) equal to its nondomination level (1<br />is the best level, 2 is the next-best level, and so on). Thus, mini-<br />mization of fitness is assumed.

We first describe the th generation<br />of the proposed algorithm as shown at the bottom of the page.<br />The step-by-step procedure shows that NSGA-II algorithm is<br />simple and straightforward. First, a combined population<br />is formed. The population<br />population<br />is sorted according to nondomination. Since all<br />previous and current population members are included in<br />elitism is ensured. Now, solutions belonging to the best non-<br />dominated set<br />are of best solutions in the combined popu-<br />lation and must be emphasized more than any other solution in<br />the combined population. If the size of<br />we definitely choose all members of the set<br />ulation<br />. The remaining members of the population<br />are chosen from subsequent nondominatedfronts in theorder of<br />their ranking. Thus, solutions from the set<br />followedbysolutionsfromtheset<br />is continued until no more sets can be accommodated. Say that<br />the set<br />is the last nondominated set beyond which no other<br />set can be accommodated. In general, the count of solutions in<br />all sets from<br />towould be larger than the population size.<br />To choose exactly<br />population members, we sort the solutions<br />of the last front<br />using the crowded-comparison operator<br />in descending order and choose the best solutions needed to fill<br />all population slots.

Test Problems<br />We first describe the test problems used to compare different<br />MOEAs. Test problems are chosen from a number of signifi-<br />cant past studies in this area. Veldhuizen [22] cited a number<br />of test problems that have been used in the past. Of them, we<br />choose four problems: Schaffer’s study (SCH) [19], Fonseca<br />andFleming’sstudy(FON)[10],Poloni’sstudy(POL)[16],and<br />Kursawe’sstudy(KUR)[15].In1999,thefirstauthorsuggested<br />a systematic way of developing test problems for multiobjec-<br />tive optimization [3]. Zitzler et al. [25] followed those guide-<br />lines and suggested six test problems. We choose five of those<br />six problems here and call them ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4,<br />and ZDT6. All problems have two objective functions. None<br />of these problems have any constraint. We describe these prob-<br />lems in Table I. The table also shows the number of variables,<br />their bounds, the Pareto-optimal solutions, and the nature of the<br />Pareto-optimal front for each problem.<br />All approaches are run for a maximum of 25000 function<br />evaluations. We use the single-point crossover and bitwise<br />mutation for binary-coded GAs and the simulated binary<br />crossover (SBX) operator and polynomial mutation [6] for<br />real-coded GAs. The crossover probability of<br />a mutation probability of<br />number of decision variables for real-coded GAs and<br />string length for binary-coded GAs) are used. For real-coded<br />NSGA-II, we use distribution indexes [6] for crossover and<br />mutation operators as<br />The population obtained at the end of 250 generations (the<br />population after elite-preserving operator is applied) is used to<br />calculate a couple of performance metrics, which we discuss<br />in the next section. For PAES, we use a depth value<br />to four and an archive size<br />members of the archive obtained at the end of 25000 iterations<br />to calculate the performance metrics. For SPEA, we use a<br />population of size 80 and an external population of size 20 (this<br />4:1 ratio is suggested by the developers of SPEA to maintain<br />an adequate selection pressure for the elite solutions), so that<br />overall population size becomes 100. SPEA is also run until<br />25000 function evaluations are done. For SPEA, we use the<br />and<br />or (whereis the<br />is the<br />and , respectively.<br />equal<br />of 100.

For PAES, SPEA, and binary-coded<br />NSGA-II, we have used 30 bits to code each decision variable.<br />B. Performance Measures<br />Unlikeinsingle-objectiveoptimization,therearetwogoalsin<br />a multiobjective optimization: 1) convergence to the Pareto-op-<br />timal set and 2) maintenance of diversity in solutions of the<br />Pareto-optimal set. These two tasks cannot be measured ade-<br />quately with one performance metric. Many performance met-<br />rics have been suggested [1], [8], [24]. Here, we define two per-<br />formance metrics that are more direct in evaluating each of the<br />above two goals in a solution set obtained by a multiobjective<br />optimization algorithm.<br />The first metric<br />measures the extent of convergence to a<br />known set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Since multiobjective al-<br />gorithms would be tested on problems having a known set of<br />Pareto-optimal solutions, the calculation of this metric is pos-<br />sible. We realize, however, that such a metric cannot be used<br />for any arbitrary problem. First, we find a set of<br />formly spaced solutions from the true Pareto-optimal front in<br />the objective space. For each solution obtained with an algo-<br />rithm, we compute the minimum Euclidean distance of it from<br />chosen solutions on the Pareto-optimal front. The average<br />of these distances is used as the first metric<br />gence metric). Fig. 3 shows the calculation procedure of this<br />metric. The shaded region is the feasible search region and the<br />solid curved lines specify the Pareto-optimal solutions. Solu-<br />tionswithopencirclesare<br />chosensolutionsonthePareto-op-<br />timal front for the calculation of the convergence metric and so-<br />lutions marked with dark circles are solutions obtained by an<br />algorithm. The smaller the value of this metric, the better the<br />convergencetowardthePareto-optimalfront.Whenallobtained<br />solutions lie exactly on<br />chosen solutions, this metric takes a<br />value of zero. In all simulations performed here, we present the<br />average<br />and varianceof thismetric calculatedfor solution<br />sets obtained in multiple runs.<br />Even when all solutions converge to the Pareto-optimal front,<br />theaboveconvergencemetricdoesnot havea valueofzero.The<br />metric will yield zero only when each obtained solution lies ex-<br />actlyoneachofthechosensolutions.Althoughthismetricalone<br />uni-<br />(the conver-<br />Fig. 4. Diversity metric ?.<br />can provide some information about the spread in obtained so-<br />lutions, we define an different metric to measure the spread in<br />solutions obtained by an algorithm directly. The second metric<br />measures the extent of spread achieved among the obtained<br />solutions. Here, we are interested in getting a set of solutions<br />that spans the entire Pareto-optimal region. We calculate the<br />Euclidean distance<br />between consecutive solutions in the ob-<br />tained nondominated set of solutions. We calculate the average<br />of these distances. Thereafter, from the obtained set of non-<br />dominated solutions, we first calculate the extreme solutions (in<br />the objective space) by fitting a curve parallel to that of the true<br />Pareto-optimal front. Then, we use the following metric to cal-<br />culate the nonuniformity in the distribution:<br />(1)<br />Here, the parameters<br />tween the extreme solutions and the boundary solutions of the<br />obtained nondominated set, as depicted in Fig. 4. The figure il-<br />lustrates all distances mentioned in the above equation. The pa-<br />rameter<br />is the average of all distances<br />, assuming that there aresolutions on the best nondomi-<br />nated front. With<br />solutions, there are<br />distances.

Since<br />SPEA could not maintain enough nondominated solutions in<br />the final GA population, the overall number of nondominated<br />solutions is much less compared to that obtained in the final<br />population of NSGA-II.<br />Next, we show the nondominated solutions on the problem<br />ZDT2inFigs.8and9.ThisproblemhasanonconvexPareto-op-<br />timalfront.Weshowtheperformanceofbinary-codedNSGA-II<br />and SPEA on this function.

Different Parameter Settings<br />In this study, we do not make any serious attempt to find the<br />best parameter setting for NSGA-II.

Table IV shows the convergence and diversity metrics<br />for problems POL, KUR, ZDT3, ZDT4, and ZDT6. Now, we<br />achieveaconvergenceveryclosetothetruePareto-optimalfront<br />and with a much better distribution. The table shows that in all<br />these difficultproblems, thereal-coded NSGA-II has converged<br />veryclosetothetrueoptimalfront,exceptinZDT6,whichprob-<br />ably requires a different parameter setting with NSGA-II. Par-<br />ticularly, the results on ZDT3 and ZDT4 improve with genera-<br />tion number.<br />The problem ZDT4 has a number of local Pareto-optimal<br />fronts, each corresponding to particular value of<br />change in the decision vector is needed to get out of a local<br />optimum. Unless mutation or crossover operators are capable<br />of creating solutions in the basin of another better attractor,<br />the improvement in the convergence toward the true Pareto-op-<br />timal front is not possible. We use NSGA-II (real-coded) with a<br />smaller distribution index<br />effect of creating solutions with more spread than before. Rest<br />of the parameter settings are identical as before.

To demonstrate the convergence and spread of so-<br />lutions, we plot the nondominated solutions of one of the runs<br />after 250generations inFig. 12. The figure shows thatNSGA-II<br />is able to find solutions on the true Pareto-optimal front with<br />.<br />V. ROTATED PROBLEMS<br />It has been discussed in an earlier study [3] that interactions<br />among decision variables can introduce another level of dif-<br />ficulty to any multiobjective optimization algorithm including<br />EAs. In this section, we create one such problem and investi-<br />gate the working of previously three MOEAs on the following<br />epistatic problem:<br />minimize<br />minimize<br />where<br />and<br />for<br />(2)<br />An EA works with the decision variable vector , but the above<br />objective functionsare definedin terms of the variable vector ,<br />which is calculated by transforming the decision variable vector<br />byafixedrotationmatrix.Thisway,theobjectivefunctions<br />are functions of a linear combination of decision variables. In<br />order to maintain a spread of solutions over the Pareto-optimal<br />region or even converge to any particular solution requires an<br />EA to update all decision variables in a particular fashion. With<br />agenericsearchoperator,suchasthevariablewiseSBXoperator<br />used here, this becomes a difficult task for an EA. However,<br />here,weareinterestedinevaluatingtheoverallbehaviorofthree<br />elitist MOEAs.<br />We use a population size of 100 and run each algorithm until<br />500 generations. For SBX, we use<br />for mutation. To restrict the Pareto-optimal solutions to lie<br />and we use</p>  <p>Page 11</p> <p>192 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 6, NO. 2, APRIL 2002<br />Fig. 13.<br />on the rotated problem.<br />Obtained nondominated solutions with NSGA-II, PAES, and SPEA<br />within the prescribed variable bounds, we discourage solutions<br />with<br />by adding a fixed large penalty to both objec-<br />tives. Fig. 13 shows the obtained solutions at the end of 500<br />generations using NSGA-II, PAES, and SPEA. It is observed<br />that NSGA-II solutions are closer to the true front compared<br />to solutions obtained by PAES and SPEA. The correlated pa-<br />rameter updates needed to progress toward the Pareto-optimal<br />front makes this kind of problems difficult to solve. NSGA-II’s<br />elite-preserving operator along with the real-coded crossover<br />andmutationoperatorsisabletofindsomesolutionsclosetothe<br />Pareto-optimal front [with<br />This example problem demonstrates that one of the known dif-<br />ficulties (the linkage problem [11], [12]) of single-objective op-<br />timization algorithm can also cause difficulties in a multiobjec-<br />tive problem. However, more systematic studies are needed to<br />amply address the linkage issue in multiobjective optimization.<br />resulting ].<br />VI. CONSTRAINT HANDLING<br />In the past, the first author and his students implemented a<br />penalty-parameterless constraint-handling approach for single-<br />objective optimization. Those studies [2], [6] have shown how<br />a tournament selection based algorithm can be used to handle<br />constraints in a population approach much better than a number<br />of other existing constraint-handling approaches. A similar ap-<br />proach can be introduced with the above NSGA-II for solving<br />constrained multiobjective optimization problems.<br />A. Proposed Constraint-Handling Approach (Constrained<br />NSGA-II)<br />This constraint-handling method uses the binary tournament<br />selection, where two solutions are picked from the population<br />and the better solution is chosen. In the presence of constraints,<br />each solution can be either feasible or infeasible. Thus, there<br />may be at most three situations: 1) both solutions are feasible;<br />2) one is feasible and other is not; and 3) both are infeasible.<br />Forsingleobjectiveoptimization,weusedasimpleruleforeach<br />case.<br />Case 1) Choose the solution with better objective function<br />value.<br />Case 2) Choose the feasible solution.<br />Case 3) Choose the solution with smaller overall constraint<br />violation.<br />Since in no case constraints and objective function values are<br />comparedwitheachother,thereisnoneedofhavinganypenalty<br />parameter,amatterthatmakestheproposedconstraint-handling<br />approach useful and attractive.<br />In the context of multiobjective optimization, the latter two<br />casescanbeusedastheyareandthefirstcasecanberesolvedby<br />using the crowded-comparison operator as before. To maintain<br />themodularityintheproceduresofNSGA-II,wesimplymodify<br />the definition of domination between two solutions and .<br />Definition 1: A solution<br />is said to constrained-dominate a<br />solution , if any of the following conditions is true.<br />1) Solution is feasible and solution<br />2) Solutions and<br />are both infeasible, but solution has a<br />smaller overall constraint violation.<br />3) Solutions<br />andare feasible and solution<br />solution .<br />The effect of using this constrained-domination principle<br />is that any feasible solution has a better nondomination rank<br />than any infeasible solution. All feasible solutions are ranked<br />according to their nondomination level based on the objective<br />function values. However, among two infeasible solutions, the<br />solution with a smaller constraint violation has a better rank.<br />Moreover, this modification in the nondomination principle<br />does not change the computational complexity of NSGA-II.<br />The rest of the NSGA-II procedure as described earlier can be<br />used as usual.<br />Theaboveconstrained-dominationdefinitionissimilartothat<br />suggested by Fonseca and Fleming [9]. The only difference is<br />in the way domination is defined for the infeasible solutions.<br />In the above definition, an infeasible solution having a larger<br />overallconstraint-violationareclassifiedasmembersofalarger<br />nondomination level. On the other hand, in [9], infeasible solu-<br />tions violating different constraints are classified as members<br />of the same nondominated front. Thus, one infeasible solution<br />violating a constraint marginally will be placed in the same<br />nondominated level with another solution violating a different<br />constraint to a large extent. This may cause an algorithm to<br />wander in the infeasible search region for more generations be-<br />fore reaching the feasible region through constraint boundaries.<br />Moreover,sinceFonseca–Fleming’sapproachrequires domina-<br />tion checks with the constraint-violation values, the proposed<br />approach of this paper is computationally less expensive and is<br />simpler.<br />is not.<br />dominates<br />B. Ray–Tai–Seow’s Constraint-Handling Approach<br />Ray et al. [17] suggested a more elaborate constraint-han-<br />dling technique, where constraint violations of all constraints<br />are not simply summed together. Instead, a nondomination<br />check of constraint violations is also made. We give an outline<br />of this procedure here.</p>  <p>Page 12</p> <p>DEB et al.: A FAST AND ELITIST MULTIOBJECTIVE GA: NSGA-II193<br />TABLE V<br />CONSTRAINED TEST PROBLEMS USED IN THIS STUDY<br />All objective functions are to be minimized.<br />Three different nondominated rankings of the population are<br />first performed. The first ranking is performed using<br />tivefunctionvaluesandtheresultingrankingisstoredina<br />mensional vector<br />. The second ranking<br />using only theconstraint violation values of all ( of them) con-<br />straints and no objective function information is used. Thus,<br />constraint violation of each constraint is used a criterion and<br />a nondomination classification of the population is performed<br />with the constraint violation values. Notice that for a feasible<br />solution all constraint violations are zero. Thus, all feasible so-<br />lutions have a rank 1 in<br />. The third ranking is performed<br />onacombinationofobjectivefunctionsandconstraint-violation<br />values [a total of<br />values]. This produces the ranking<br />. Although objective function values and constraint viola-<br />tions are used together, one nice aspect of this algorithm is that<br />there is no need for any penalty parameter. In the domination<br />check, criteria are compared individually, thereby eliminating<br />theneedofanypenaltyparameter.Oncetheserankingsareover,<br />all feasible solutions having the best rank in<br />for the new population. If more population slots are available,<br />theyarecreatedfromtheremainingsolutionssystematically.By<br />giving importance to the ranking in<br />erator and by giving importance to the ranking in<br />crossover operator, the investigators laid out a systematic multi-<br />objective GA, which also includes a niche-preserving operator.<br />For details, readers may refer to [17]. Although the investiga-<br />tors did not compare their algorithm with any other method,<br />they showed the working of this constraint-handling method<br />on a number of engineering design problems. However, since<br />nondominated sorting of three different sets of criteria are re-<br />quired and the algorithm introduces many different operators,<br />it remains to be investigated how it performs on more complex<br />objec-<br />-di-<br />is performed<br />are chosen<br />in the selection op-<br />in the<br />problems, particularly from the point of view of computational<br />burden associated with the method.<br />In the following section, we choose a set of four prob-<br />lems and compare the simple constrained NSGA-II with the<br />Ray–Tai–Seow’s method.<br />C. Simulation Results<br />We choose four constrained test problems (see Table V) that<br />have been used in earlier studies. In the first problem, a part of<br />the unconstrained Pareto-optimal region is not feasible. Thus,<br />the resulting constrained Pareto-optimal region is a concatena-<br />tion of the first constraint boundary and some part of the uncon-<br />strained Pareto-optimal region. The second problem SRN was<br />used in the original study of NSGA [20]. Here, the constrained<br />Pareto-optimal set is a subset of the unconstrained Pareto-op-<br />timal set. The third problem TNK was suggested by Tanaka et<br />al. [21] and has a discontinuous Pareto-optimal region, falling<br />entirely on the first constraint boundary. In the next section,<br />we show the constrained Pareto-optimal region for each of the<br />above problems. The fourth problem WATER is a five-objec-<br />tive and seven-constraint problem, attempted to solve in [17].<br />With five objectives, it is difficult to discuss the effect of the<br />constraints on the unconstrained Pareto-optimal region. In the<br />next section, we show all<br />or ten pairwise plots of obtained<br />nondominated solutions. We apply real-coded NSGA-II here.<br />In all problems, we use a population size of 100, distribu-<br />tion indexes for real-coded crossover and mutation operators<br />of 20 and 100, respectively, and run NSGA-II (real coded)<br />with the proposed constraint-handling technique and with<br />Ray–Tai–Seow’s constraint-handling algorithm [17] for a<br />maximum of 500 generations. We choose this rather large<br />number of generations to investigate if the spread in solutions</p>  <p>Page 13</p> <p>194IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 6, NO. 2, APRIL 2002<br />Fig. 14.<br />problem CONSTR.<br />Obtained nondominated solutions with NSGA-II on the constrained<br />Fig. 15.<br />the constrained problem CONSTR.<br />Obtained nondominated solutions with Ray-Tai-Seow’s algorithm on<br />can be maintained for a large number of generations. However,<br />in each case, we obtain a reasonably good spread of solutions as<br />early as 200 generations. Crossover and mutation probabilities<br />are the same as before.<br />Fig. 14 shows the obtained set of 100 nondominated solu-<br />tions after 500 generations using NSGA-II. The figure shows<br />that NSGA-II is able to uniformly maintain solutions in both<br />Pareto-optimal region. It is important to note that in order to<br />maintain a spread of solutions on the constraint boundary, the<br />solutions must have to be modified in a particular manner dic-<br />tated by the constraint function. This becomes a difficult task of<br />any search operator. Fig. 15 shows the obtained solutions using<br />Ray-Tai-Seow’s algorithm after 500 generations. It is clear that<br />NSGA-II performs better than Ray–Tai–Seow’s algorithm in<br />terms of converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and also<br />in terms of maintaining a diverse population of nondominated<br />solutions.<br />Next, we consider the test problem SRN. Fig. 16 shows the<br />nondominated solutions after 500 generations using NSGA-II.<br />Fig. 16.<br />problem SRN.<br />Obtained nondominated solutions with NSGA-II on the constrained<br />Fig.17.<br />the constrained problem SRN.<br />ObtainednondominatedsolutionswithRay–Tai–Seow’salgorithmon<br />The figure shows how NSGA-II can bring a random population<br />on the Pareto-optimal front. Ray–Tai–Seow’s algorithm is also<br />able to come close to the front on this test problem (Fig. 17).<br />Figs. 18 and 19 show the feasible objective space and<br />the obtained nondominated solutions with NSGA-II and<br />Ray–Tai–Seow’s algorithm. Here, the Pareto-optimal region<br />is discontinuous and NSGA-II does not have any difficulty in<br />finding a wide spread of solutions over the true Pareto-optimal<br />region. Although Ray–Tai–Seow’s algorithm found a number<br />of solutions on the Pareto-optimal front, there exist many<br />infeasible solutions even after 500 generations. In order to<br />demonstrate the working of Fonseca–Fleming’s constraint-han-<br />dling strategy, we implement it with NSGA-II and apply on<br />TNK. Fig. 20 shows 100 population members at the end of<br />500 generations and with identical parameter setting as used in<br />Fig. 18. Both these figures demonstrate that the proposed and<br />Fonseca–Fleming’s constraint-handling strategies work well<br />with NSGA-II.</p>  <p>Page 14</p> <p>DEB et al.: A FAST AND ELITIST MULTIOBJECTIVE GA: NSGA-II195<br />Fig. 18.<br />problem TNK.<br />Obtained nondominated solutions with NSGA-II on the constrained<br />Fig.19.<br />the constrained problem TNK.<br />ObtainednondominatedsolutionswithRay–Tai–Seow’salgorithmon<br />Ray et al. [17] have used the problem WATER in their<br />study. They normalized the objective functions in the following<br />manner:<br />Since there are five objective functions in the problem WATER,<br />we observe the range of the normalized objective function<br />values of the obtained nondominated solutions. Table VI shows<br />the comparison with Ray–Tai–Seow’s algorithm. In most<br />objective functions, NSGA-II has found a better spread of<br />solutions than Ray–Tai–Seow’s approach. In order to show the<br />pairwise interactions among these five normalized objective<br />functions, we plot all<br />or ten interactions in Fig. 21 for both<br />algorithms. NSGA-II results are shown in the upper diagonal<br />portion of the figure and the Ray–Tai–Seow’s results are shown<br />in the lower diagonal portion. The axes of any plot can be<br />obtained by looking at the corresponding diagonal boxes and<br />their ranges. For example, the plot at the first row and third<br />column has its vertical axis as<br />Since this plot belongs in the upper side of the diagonal, this<br />and horizontal axis as.<br />Fig.<br />constraint-handling strategy with NSGA-II on the constrained problem TNK.<br />20. Obtained nondominatedsolutionswith Fonseca–Fleming’s<br />plot is obtained using NSGA-II. In order to compare this plot<br />with a similar plot using Ray–Tai–Seow’s approach, we look<br />for the plot in the third row and first column. For this figure, the<br />vertical axis is plotted as<br />and the horizontal axis is plotted<br />as<br />. To get a better comparison between these two plots, we<br />observe Ray–Tai–Seow’s plot as it is, but turn the page 90 in<br />the clockwise direction for NSGA-II results. This would make<br />the labeling and ranges of the axes same in both cases.<br />We observe that NSGA-II plots have better formed patterns<br />than in Ray–Tai–Seow’s plots. For example, figures<br />-, and -interactions are very clear from NSGA-II<br />results. Although similar patterns exist in the results obtained<br />using Ray–Tai–Seow’s algorithm, the convergence to the true<br />fronts is not adequate.<br />-,<br />VII. CONCLUSION<br />We have proposed a computationally fast and elitist MOEA<br />based on a nondominated sorting approach. On nine different<br />difficult test problems borrowed from the literature, the pro-<br />posed NSGA-II was able to maintain a better spread of solu-<br />tions and converge better in the obtained nondominated front<br />compared to two other elitist MOEAs—PAES and SPEA. How-<br />ever,one problem,PAES,wasabletoconvergeclosertothetrue<br />Pareto-optimalfront.PAESmaintainsdiversityamongsolutions<br />by controlling crowding of solutions in a deterministic and pre-<br />specified number of equal-sized cells in the search space. In<br />that problem, it is suspected that such a deterministic crowding<br />coupled with the effect of mutation-based approach has been<br />beneficial in converging near the true front compared to the dy-<br />namic and parameterless crowding approach used in NSGA-II<br />and SPEA. However, the diversity preserving mechanism used<br />in NSGA-II is found to be the best among the three approaches<br />studied here.<br />Onaproblemhavingstrongparameter interactions,NSGA-II<br />has been able to come closer to the true front than the other<br />two approaches, but the important matter is that all three<br />approaches faced difficulties in solving this so-called highly<br />epistatic problem.

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (we called it the Non-dominated Sorting GA-II or NSGA-II) which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN 2) computational complexity is presented. Second, a selection operator is presented which creates a mating pool by combining the parent and child populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on a number of difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to PAES and SPEA two other elitist multi-objective EAs which pay special attention towards creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint non-linear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed. Because of NSGA-II's low computational requirements, elitist approach, parameter-less niching approach, and simple constraint-handling strategy, NSGA-II should find increasing applications in the coming years.<\/div>","canEdit":false,"isAdmin":false,"isArtifact":false,"showFullAbstract":true,"widgetId":"rgw17_56aba1cfca73e"},"id":"rgw17_56aba1cfca73e","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationAbstract.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":[],"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationAbstract.html?publicationUid=2526557","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationAbstractView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationAbstractView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"publicationKeywords":null,"publicationState":null,"isGuest":true,"isAdminEditingAllowed":false,"isArtifact":false,"figureListWidget":null,"previewImage":"https:\/\/i1.rgstatic.net\/publication\/2526557_A_fast_and_elitist_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA_II\/links\/0e5fab8df0c41c4932e31b21\/smallpreview.png","nativeAdDisclosure":null,"showFollowPublicationButton":false,"followPublicationPromo":"","widgetId":"rgw5_56aba1cfca73e"},"id":"rgw5_56aba1cfca73e","partials":[],"templateName":"publicliterature\/stubs\/PublicationDetailItem.html","templateExtensions":["generalHelpers"],"attrs":{"preSignUpDialogContext":null},"widgetUrl":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publicliterature.PublicationDetailItem.html?publicationUid=2526557&showActionBar=0&showContactAuthorButton=1&showRequestFulltextExperience=0&showNoRgAuthorsRequestFulltextExperience=0&showFollowPublicationPromo=0","viewClass":"views.publicliterature.PublicationDetailItemView","yuiModules":["rg.views.publicliterature.PublicationDetailItemView"],"stylesheets":[],"_isYUI":true},"similarPublications":{"data":{"publicationListItems":[{"data":{"milestones":{"moreContext":"experimentMilestoneClickedCitationContextReadMore"},"nextPublicationMilestone":"experimentMilestoneRequestFulltextNoPreview","nextPublicationViewId":null,"authorsPartOne":[{"id":2095624690,"url":"researcher\/2095624690_E_Tlelo-Cuautle","fullname":"E.

The primary reason for this is their ability to find\nmultiple Pareto-optimal solutions in one single simulation run.\nSince evolutionary algorithms (EAs) work with a population of\nsolutions, a simple EA can be extended to maintain a diverse\nset of solutions. With an emphasis for moving toward the true\nPareto-optimal region, an EA can be used to find multiple\nPareto-optimal solutions in one single simulation run.\nThe nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) pro-\nposed in [20] was one of the first such EAs. Over the years, the\nmain criticisms of the NSGA approach have been as follows.\n1) Highcomputationalcomplexityofnondominatedsorting:\nThecurrently-used nondominatedsorting algorithm hasa\ncomputational complexity of\nnumber of objectives and\nmakes NSGA computationally expensive for large popu-\nlation sizes. This large complexity arises because of the\ncomplexity involved in the nondominated sorting proce-\ndure in every generation.\n2) Lackofelitism:Recentresults[25],[18]showthatelitism\ncan speed up the performance of the GA significantly,\nwhich also can help preventing the loss of good solutions\nonce they are found.\n3) Need for specifying the sharing parameter\ntionalmechanismsofensuringdiversityinapopulationso\nas to get a wide variety of equivalent solutions have relied\nmostly on the concept of sharing. The main problem with\nsharing is that it requires the specification of a sharing\nparameter (\n). Though there has been some work on\ndynamic sizing of the sharing parameter [10], a param-\neter-less diversity-preservation mechanism is desirable.\nIn this paper, we address all of these issues and propose an\nimproved version of NSGA, which we call NSGA-II. From the\nsimulationresultsonanumberofdifficulttestproblems,wefind\nthat NSGA-II outperforms two other contemporary MOEAs:\nPareto-archived evolution strategy (PAES) [14] and strength-\nPareto EA (SPEA) [24] in terms of finding a diverse set of so-\nlutions and in converging near the true Pareto-optimal set.\nConstrainedmultiobjectiveoptimizationisimportantfromthe\npointofviewofpracticalproblemsolving,butnotmuchattention\nhas been paid so far in this respect among the EA researchers.\nIn this paper, we suggest a simple constraint-handling strategy\nwith NSGA-II that suits well for any EA.

Finally, we outline the conclusions of this paper.\nII. ELITIST MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS\nDuring 1993\u20131995, a number of different EAs were sug-\ngested to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Of them,\nFonseca and Fleming\u2019s MOGA [7], Srinivas and Deb\u2019s NSGA\n[20], and Horn et al.\u2019s NPGA [13] enjoyed more attention.\nThese algorithms demonstrated the necessary additional oper-\nators for converting a simple EA to a MOEA. Two common\nfeatures on all three operators were the following: i) assigning\nfitness to population members based on nondominated sorting\nand ii) preserving diversity among solutions of the same\nnondominated front. Although they have been shown to find\nmultiple nondominated solutions on many test problems and a\nnumber of engineering design problems, researchers realized\nthe need of introducing more useful operators (which have\nbeen found useful in single-objective EA\u2019s) so as to solve\nmultiobjective optimization problems better. Particularly,\nthe interest has been to introduce elitism to enhance the\nconvergence properties of a MOEA. Reference [25] showed\nthat elitism helps in achieving better convergence in MOEAs.\nAmong the existing elitist MOEAs, Zitzler and Thiele\u2019s SPEA\n[26], Knowles and Corne\u2019s Pareto-archived PAES [14], and\nRudolph\u2019s elitist GA [18] are well studied. We describe these\napproaches in brief. For details, readers are encouraged to refer\nto the original studies.\nZitzler and Thiele [26] suggested an elitist multicriterion EA\nwith the concept of nondomination in their SPEA. They sug-\ngested maintaining an external population at every generation\nstoring all nondominated solutions discovered so far beginning\nfrom the initial population. This external population partici-\npates in all genetic operations. At each generation, a combined\npopulation with the external and the current population is first\nconstructed. All nondominated solutions in the combined pop-\nulation are assigned a fitness based on the number of solutions\nthey dominate and dominated solutions are assigned fitness\nworse than the worst fitness of any nondominated solution.\nThis assignment of fitness makes sure that the search is directed\ntoward the nondominated solutions. A deterministic clustering\ntechnique is used to ensure diversity among nondominated\nsolutions. Although the implementation suggested in [26] is\n, with proper bookkeeping the complexity of SPEA\ncan be reduced to\n.\nKnowles and Corne [14] suggested a simple MOEA using\na single-parent single-offspring EA similar to (1 1)-evolution\nstrategy. Instead of using real parameters, binary strings were\nused and bitwise mutations were employed to create offsprings.\nIn their PAES, with one parent and one offspring, the offspring\nis compared with respect to the parent. If the offspring domi-\nnates the parent, the offspring is accepted as the next parent and\nthe iteration continues. On the other hand, if the parent dom-\ninates the offspring, the offspring is discarded and a new mu-\ntated solution (a new offspring) is found. However, if the off-\nspring and the parent do not dominate each other, the choice be-\ntween the offspring and the parent is made by comparing them\nwith an archive of best solutions found so far. The offspring is\ncompared with the archive to check if it dominates any member\nof the archive. If it does, the offspring is accepted as the new\nparent and all the dominated solutions are eliminated from the\narchive. If the offspring does not dominate any member of the\narchive, both parent and offspring are checked for their near-\nness with the solutions of the archive. If the offspring resides in\na least crowded region in the objective space among the mem-\nbers ofthearchive,it is acceptedas a parentanda copy of added\nto the archive. Crowding is maintained by dividing the entire\nsearch space deterministically in\ndepth parameter and\nis the number of decision variables, and\nby updating the subspaces dynamically. Investigators have cal-\nculated the worst case complexity of PAES for\nas\n, where is the archive length. Since the archive\nsize is usually chosen proportional to the population size\noverall complexity of the algorithm is\nRudolph [18] suggested, but did not simulate, a simple elitist\nMOEA based on a systematic comparison of individuals from\nparent and offspring populations. The nondominated solutions\nof the offspring population are compared with that of parent so-\nlutions to form an overall nondominated set of solutions, which\nbecomes the parent population of the next iteration. If the size\nof this set is not greater than the desired population size, other\nindividuals from the offspring population are included. With\nthis strategy, he proved the convergence of this algorithm to the\nPareto-optimalfront.Althoughthisisanimportantachievement\nin its own right, the algorithm lacks motivation for the second\ntaskofmaintainingdiversityofPareto-optimalsolutions.Anex-\nplicit diversity-preserving mechanism must be added to make it\nmore practical. Since the determinism of the first nondominated\nfront is\n, the overall complexity of Rudolph\u2019s algo-\nrithm is also\n.\nIn the following, we present the proposed nondominated\nsorting GA approach, which uses a fast nondominated sorting\nprocedure, an elitist-preserving approach, and a parameterless\nniching operator.\nsubspaces, where is the\nevaluations\n, the\n.\nIII.

Diversity Preservation\nWe mentioned earlier that, along with convergence to the\nPareto-optimalset,itisalsodesiredthatanEAmaintainsagood\nspread of solutions in the obtained set of solutions. The original\nNSGA used the well-known sharing function approach, which\nhas been found to maintain sustainable diversity in a popula-\ntion with appropriate setting of its associated parameters. The\nsharing function method involves a sharing parameter\nwhich sets the extent of sharing desired in a problem. This pa-\nrameter is related to the distance metric chosen to calculate the\nproximity measure between two population members. The pa-\nrameter\ndenotes the largest value of that distance metric\nwithin which any two solutions share each other\u2019s fitness. This\nparameter is usually set by the user, although there exist some\nguidelines [4].

The new approach\ndoes not require any user-defined parameter for maintaining\ndiversity among population members. Also, the suggested ap-\nproach has a better computational complexity. To describe this\napproach, we first define a density-estimation metric and then\npresent the crowded-comparison operator.\n1) Density Estimation: To get an estimate of the density of\nsolutionssurroundinga particularsolutioninthepopulation,we\ncalculate the average distance of two points on either side of\nthis point along each of the objectives. This quantity\nserves as an estimate of the perimeter of the cuboid formed by\nusingthenearestneighborsasthevertices(callthisthecrowding\ndistance). In Fig. 1, the crowding distance of the th solution in\nits front (marked with solid circles) is the average side length of\nthe cuboid (shown with a dashed box).\nThe crowding-distance computation requires sorting the pop-\nulation according to each objective function value in ascending\norder of magnitude. Thereafter, for each objective function, the\nboundarysolutions (solutionswithsmallestand largestfunction\nvalues) are assigned an infinite distance value. All other inter-\nmediate solutions are assigned a distance value equal to the ab-\nsolute normalized difference in the function values of two adja-\ncentsolutions.Thiscalculationiscontinuedwithotherobjective\nfunctions. The overall crowding-distance value is calculated as\nthe sum of individual distance values corresponding to each ob-\njective.Eachobjectivefunctionisnormalizedbeforecalculating\nthe crowding distance.

Since\nindependent sortings of at most\ntions (when all population members are in one front\nvolved, the above algorithm has\ncomplexity.\nAfter all population members in the set\ndistance metric, we can compare two solutions for their extent\nof proximity with other solutions. A solution with a smaller\nvalue of this distance measure is, in some sense, more crowded\nby other solutions. This is exactly what we compare in the\nproposed crowded-comparison operator, described below.\nAlthough Fig. 1 illustrates the crowding-distance computation\nfor two objectives, the procedure is applicable to more than two\nobjectives as well.\n2) Crowded-Comparison Operator: The crowded-compar-\nison operator (\n) guides the selection process at the various\nstages of the algorithm toward a uniformly spread-out Pareto-\noptimal front. Assume that every individual in the population\nhas two attributes:\n1) nondomination rank (\n2) crowding distance (\nWe now define a partial order\nrefers to the th objective function value of the\nand the parametersand are\nth objective func-\nsolu-\n) are in-\ncomputational\nare assigned a\n);\n).\nas\nif\nor\nand\nThat is, between two solutions with differing nondomination\nranks,we preferthesolutionwiththelower(better)rank.Other-\nwise, if both solutions belong to the same front, then we prefer\nthe solution that is located in a lesser crowded region.\nWith these three new innovations\u2014a fast nondominated\nsorting procedure, a fast crowded distance estimation proce-\ndure, and a simple crowded comparison operator, we are now\nready to describe the NSGA-II algorithm.\nC. Main Loop\nInitially, a random parent population\nulation is sorted based on the nondomination. Each solution is\nassigned a fitness (or rank) equal to its nondomination level (1\nis the best level, 2 is the next-best level, and so on). Thus, mini-\nmization of fitness is assumed.

We first describe the th generation\nof the proposed algorithm as shown at the bottom of the page.\nThe step-by-step procedure shows that NSGA-II algorithm is\nsimple and straightforward. First, a combined population\nis formed. The population\npopulation\nis sorted according to nondomination. Since all\nprevious and current population members are included in\nelitism is ensured.

Test Problems\nWe first describe the test problems used to compare different\nMOEAs. Test problems are chosen from a number of signifi-\ncant past studies in this area. Veldhuizen [22] cited a number\nof test problems that have been used in the past. Of them, we\nchoose four problems: Schaffer\u2019s study (SCH) [19], Fonseca\nandFleming\u2019sstudy(FON)[10],Poloni\u2019sstudy(POL)[16],and\nKursawe\u2019sstudy(KUR)[15].In1999,thefirstauthorsuggested\na systematic way of developing test problems for multiobjec-\ntive optimization [3]. Zitzler et al. [25] followed those guide-\nlines and suggested six test problems. We choose five of those\nsix problems here and call them ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4,\nand ZDT6. All problems have two objective functions. None\nof these problems have any constraint. We describe these prob-\nlems in Table I. The table also shows the number of variables,\ntheir bounds, the Pareto-optimal solutions, and the nature of the\nPareto-optimal front for each problem.\nAll approaches are run for a maximum of 25000 function\nevaluations.

Performance Measures\nUnlikeinsingle-objectiveoptimization,therearetwogoalsin\na multiobjective optimization: 1) convergence to the Pareto-op-\ntimal set and 2) maintenance of diversity in solutions of the\nPareto-optimal set. These two tasks cannot be measured ade-\nquately with one performance metric. Many performance met-\nrics have been suggested [1], [8], [24]. Here, we define two per-\nformance metrics that are more direct in evaluating each of the\nabove two goals in a solution set obtained by a multiobjective\noptimization algorithm.\nThe first metric\nmeasures the extent of convergence to a\nknown set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Since multiobjective al-\ngorithms would be tested on problems having a known set of\nPareto-optimal solutions, the calculation of this metric is pos-\nsible. We realize, however, that such a metric cannot be used\nfor any arbitrary problem. First, we find a set of\nformly spaced solutions from the true Pareto-optimal front in\nthe objective space. For each solution obtained with an algo-\nrithm, we compute the minimum Euclidean distance of it from\nchosen solutions on the Pareto-optimal front. The average\nof these distances is used as the first metric\ngence metric). Fig. 3 shows the calculation procedure of this\nmetric. The shaded region is the feasible search region and the\nsolid curved lines specify the Pareto-optimal solutions. Solu-\ntionswithopencirclesare\nchosensolutionsonthePareto-op-\ntimal front for the calculation of the convergence metric and so-\nlutions marked with dark circles are solutions obtained by an\nalgorithm. The smaller the value of this metric, the better the\nconvergencetowardthePareto-optimalfront.Whenallobtained\nsolutions lie exactly on\nchosen solutions, this metric takes a\nvalue of zero. In all simulations performed here, we present the\naverage\nand varianceof thismetric calculatedfor solution\nsets obtained in multiple runs.\nEven when all solutions converge to the Pareto-optimal front,\ntheaboveconvergencemetricdoesnot havea valueofzero.The\nmetric will yield zero only when each obtained solution lies ex-\nactlyoneachofthechosensolutions.Althoughthismetricalone\nuni-\n(the conver-\nFig. 4. Diversity metric ?.\ncan provide some information about the spread in obtained so-\nlutions, we define an different metric to measure the spread in\nsolutions obtained by an algorithm directly. The second metric\nmeasures the extent of spread achieved among the obtained\nsolutions. Here, we are interested in getting a set of solutions\nthat spans the entire Pareto-optimal region. We calculate the\nEuclidean distance\nbetween consecutive solutions in the ob-\ntained nondominated set of solutions. We calculate the average\nof these distances. Thereafter, from the obtained set of non-\ndominated solutions, we first calculate the extreme solutions (in\nthe objective space) by fitting a curve parallel to that of the true\nPareto-optimal front. Then, we use the following metric to cal-\nculate the nonuniformity in the distribution:\n(1)\nHere, the parameters\ntween the extreme solutions and the boundary solutions of the\nobtained nondominated set, as depicted in Fig. 4.

CONSTRAINT HANDLING\nIn the past, the first author and his students implemented a\npenalty-parameterless constraint-handling approach for single-\nobjective optimization. Those studies [2], [6] have shown how\na tournament selection based algorithm can be used to handle\nconstraints in a population approach much better than a number\nof other existing constraint-handling approaches. A similar ap-\nproach can be introduced with the above NSGA-II for solving\nconstrained multiobjective optimization problems.\nA. Proposed Constraint-Handling Approach (Constrained\nNSGA-II)\nThis constraint-handling method uses the binary tournament\nselection, where two solutions are picked from the population\nand the better solution is chosen. In the presence of constraints,\neach solution can be either feasible or infeasible. Thus, there\nmay be at most three situations: 1) both solutions are feasible;\n2) one is feasible and other is not; and 3) both are infeasible.\nForsingleobjectiveoptimization,weusedasimpleruleforeach\ncase.\nCase 1) Choose the solution with better objective function\nvalue.\nCase 2) Choose the feasible solution.\nCase 3) Choose the solution with smaller overall constraint\nviolation.\nSince in no case constraints and objective function values are\ncomparedwitheachother,thereisnoneedofhavinganypenalty\nparameter,amatterthatmakestheproposedconstraint-handling\napproach useful and attractive.\nIn the context of multiobjective optimization, the latter two\ncasescanbeusedastheyareandthefirstcasecanberesolvedby\nusing the crowded-comparison operator as before. To maintain\nthemodularityintheproceduresofNSGA-II,wesimplymodify\nthe definition of domination between two solutions and .\nDefinition 1: A solution\nis said to constrained-dominate a\nsolution , if any of the following conditions is true.\n1) Solution is feasible and solution\n2) Solutions and\nare both infeasible, but solution has a\nsmaller overall constraint violation.\n3) Solutions\nandare feasible and solution\nsolution .\nThe effect of using this constrained-domination principle\nis that any feasible solution has a better nondomination rank\nthan any infeasible solution. All feasible solutions are ranked\naccording to their nondomination level based on the objective\nfunction values. However, among two infeasible solutions, the\nsolution with a smaller constraint violation has a better rank.\nMoreover, this modification in the nondomination principle\ndoes not change the computational complexity of NSGA-II.\nThe rest of the NSGA-II procedure as described earlier can be\nused as usual.\nTheaboveconstrained-dominationdefinitionissimilartothat\nsuggested by Fonseca and Fleming [9]. The only difference is\nin the way domination is defined for the infeasible solutions.\nIn the above definition, an infeasible solution having a larger\noverallconstraint-violationareclassifiedasmembersofalarger\nnondomination level. On the other hand, in [9], infeasible solu-\ntions violating different constraints are classified as members\nof the same nondominated front. Thus, one infeasible solution\nviolating a constraint marginally will be placed in the same\nnondominated level with another solution violating a different\nconstraint to a large extent. This may cause an algorithm to\nwander in the infeasible search region for more generations be-\nfore reaching the feasible region through constraint boundaries.\nMoreover,sinceFonseca\u2013Fleming\u2019sapproachrequires domina-\ntion checks with the constraint-violation values, the proposed\napproach of this paper is computationally less expensive and is\nsimpler.\nis not.\ndominates\nB.

Instead, a nondomination\ncheck of constraint violations is also made.

Simulation Results\nWe choose four constrained test problems (see Table V) that\nhave been used in earlier studies. In the first problem, a part of\nthe unconstrained Pareto-optimal region is not feasible. Thus,\nthe resulting constrained Pareto-optimal region is a concatena-\ntion of the first constraint boundary and some part of the uncon-\nstrained Pareto-optimal region. The second problem SRN was\nused in the original study of NSGA [20]. Here, the constrained\nPareto-optimal set is a subset of the unconstrained Pareto-op-\ntimal set. The third problem TNK was suggested by Tanaka et\nal. [21] and has a discontinuous Pareto-optimal region, falling\nentirely on the first constraint boundary. In the next section,\nwe show the constrained Pareto-optimal region for each of the\nabove problems. The fourth problem WATER is a five-objec-\ntive and seven-constraint problem, attempted to solve in [17].\nWith five objectives, it is difficult to discuss the effect of the\nconstraints on the unconstrained Pareto-optimal region.

To get a better comparison between these two plots, we\nobserve Ray\u2013Tai\u2013Seow\u2019s plot as it is, but turn the page 90 in\nthe clockwise direction for NSGA-II results. This would make\nthe labeling and ranges of the axes same in both cases.\nWe observe that NSGA-II plots have better formed patterns\nthan in Ray\u2013Tai\u2013Seow\u2019s plots.

Although similar patterns exist in the results obtained\nusing Ray\u2013Tai\u2013Seow\u2019s algorithm, the convergence to the true\nfronts is not adequate.\n-,\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWe have proposed a computationally fast and elitist MOEA\nbased on a nondominated sorting approach. On nine different\ndifficult test problems borrowed from the literature, the pro-\nposed NSGA-II was able to maintain a better spread of solu-\ntions and converge better in the obtained nondominated front\ncompared to two other elitist MOEAs\u2014PAES and SPEA. How-\never,one problem,PAES,wasabletoconvergeclosertothetrue\nPareto-optimalfront.PAESmaintainsdiversityamongsolutions\nby controlling crowding of solutions in a deterministic and pre-\nspecified number of equal-sized cells in the search space. In\nthat problem, it is suspected that such a deterministic crowding\ncoupled with the effect of mutation-based approach has been\nbeneficial in converging near the true front compared to the dy-\nnamic and parameterless crowding approach used in NSGA-II\nand SPEA. However, the diversity preserving mechanism used\nin NSGA-II is found to be the best among the three approaches\nstudied here.\nOnaproblemhavingstrongparameter interactions,NSGA-II\nhas been able to come closer to the true front than the other\ntwo approaches, but the important matter is that all three\napproaches faced difficulties in solving this so-called highly\nepistatic problem.
